China's central bank has warned companies against assisting cryptocurrency-related businesses as it shut down a software firm over suspected involvement in digital currency transactions. Beijing has turned a sharp eye on cryptocurrency in recent months as it widens its regulatory crackdown on the tech sector. Cryptocurrency trading is banned in China, and authorities have recently closed mines and warned banks to halt related transactions. On Tuesday, a Beijing office of the central bank ordered the closure of software company Beijing Qudao Cultural Development, alleging it had been involved in providing software services for cryptocurrency transactions. The move was necessary \"to prevent and control the risk of speculation in virtual currency transactions, and protect the safety of the public's assets\", it said in a statement. The bank also warned organisations not to \"provide premises, commercial display, advertising ... and other services for cryptocurrency-related business activities\".

The demand was posted on a blog typically used by the REvil cybercrime gang, a Russia-linked group that is counted among the cybercriminal world's most prolific extortionists. The gang has an affiliate structure, occasionally making it difficult to determine who speaks on the hackers' behalf, but Allan Liska of cybersecurity firm Recorded Future said the message \"almost certainly\" came from REvil's core leadership.

In a statement on Wednesday, La Liga said it had agreed in principle a \"multipronged\" deal with CVC including the $3.2 billion infusions in return for 10 percent of its revenue, as well as the creation of a newly formed company housing a range of commercial activities in which CVC would also take a 10 percent stake. The Spanish football league's Executive Committee later approved the plan, dubbed \"Boost La Liga\" (La Liga Impulso), and it will now be voted on by all league members at a General Assembly on a date to be set. The deal values La Liga at around $28.7 billion in total and, if approved by clubs, will fund what it called \"structural improvements\" while offsetting some of the immediate impact from Covid-19, the league said in a statement. Barca and Real Madrid to get biggest chunks La Liga said the cash injection - 90 percent of which will go to clubs - would be distributed on the basis of a formula derived from average audiovisual revenues over the last seven years, when La Liga started commercialising rights as a collective - implying the top two would get the biggest chunks.

Ether held near two-month highs ahead of a major adjustment to its underlying ethereum blockchain that would alter the way transactions are processed. The revamp is anticipated to go live on Thursday at approximately 1200 GMT, according to market players. Technically, the upgrade will occur when the 12,965,000th block on the blockchain has been verified. Ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, fell 0.5% on Thursday, but has risen about 18% this week and is at its highest level since early June, in the aftermath of May's crypto market plunge. The ethereum network underpins a range of projects in the crypto world including non fungible tokens (NFTs) - a crypto asset, representing an intangible digital item such as an image, video, or in-game item - as well many decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. The upgrade, known as the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, will alter the way transactions are processed and provide clearer pricing for them. It will also reduce the supply of the ether token and is likely to sharply boost its price. Several large exchanges including Binance and OKEx have said they will suspend deposits and withdrawals of ether and ether-based assets around the time of the adjustment. They said this was necessary to reduce the trading risks brought about by price volatility and to maintain the safety of user funds."}

China's biggest ride-hailing firm Didi Global Inc has said that the removal of its \"DiDi Chuxing\" app from smartphone app stores in China is expected to have an adverse impact on its revenue. Earlier on Sunday, China's cyberspace regulator ordered app stores to stop offering Didi's app after finding that the company had illegally collected users' personal data. \"The Company expects that the app takedown may have an adverse impact on its revenue in China,\" the company said in a statement. The removal of Didi's app, which does not affect existing users, comes days after Didi made its trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange in an initial public offering that raised $4.4 billion. In a June filing, Didi reported revenue of about $6.5 billion (42.2 billion yuan) for the three months ended March 31. Of that, $6 billion (39.2 billion yuan) came from its China mobility division while about $123.7 million (800 million yuan )came from its international business. Didi has a dominant position in the online ride-hailing business in China and operates in 4,000 locations across 16 countries. Didi said it will strive to rectify any problems, and will protect users' privacy and data security. Internet crackdown Since late last year, Chinese internet regulators have cracked down more sharply on the country's tech giants for violations of rules. The Global Times , a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper, said in a Chinese-language commentary on Monday that Didi's apparent \"big data analysis\" capability could pose risks to the security of individuals' personal information. \"No internet giant can be allowed to become a super database of Chinese people's personal information that contains more details than the country, and these companies cannot be allowed to use the data however they want,\" Global Times said.

The company has launched what it promised would be a far-reaching review of its workplace practices after the state lawsuit alleging wide-ranging discrimination and harassment of female employees. The lawsuit detailed inappropriate behaviour, describing male employees who allegedly groped female co-workers and who would \"talk openly about female bodies, and joke about rape.\" Some employees and activists called the company's reaction to the case inadequate, leading to the July 28 protests. A statement which organisers said was signed by 2,600 employees called for an end to mandatory arbitration in harassment cases, improvements in recruiting practices and creation of a diversity and equity task force.

Australian airline Qantas announced Tuesday it will furlough 2,500 workers as coronavirus outbreaks and regional lockdowns pummel demand for flights. Pilots, cabin crew and airport workers from Qantas and its low-cost affiliate Jetstar will be sent home without pay from mid-August for an estimated two months, the firm said. \"This is clearly the last thing we want to do, but we're now faced with an extended period of reduced flying and that means no work for a number of our people,\" CEO Alan Joyce said in a statement. Qantas said the airline had gone from operating almost 100 percent of its usual domestic flying capacity in May to less than 40 percent in July due to coronavirus restrictions. Most of the affected staff are based in New South Wales, a state that is largely cut off from the rest of the country and the world by travel restrictions. A lockdown in the country's largest city, Sydney, is now in its sixth week and is likely to last for at least another month. Qantas and Jetstar have already stood down thousands of international air crew since early 2020, with Australia's borders remaining closed to most overseas travellers. The country's third-biggest city, Brisbane, is currently under stay-at-home orders while other states have only recently emerged from lockdowns. Qantas said staff will be paid for two weeks before the change comes into effect. \"Based on current case numbers, it's reasonable to assume that Sydney's borders will be closed for at least another two months,\" Joyce said. \"We know it will take a few weeks once the outbreak is under control before other states open to New South Wales and normal travel can resume.\" Qantas, which previously said it had seen an $8.1 billion plunge in revenue during 2020, embarked on a cost-cutting blitz last year that included grounding planes and restructuring."}

The semiconductor shortage that has gripped the world could last well into 2022 and hit smartphone production next, foreshadowing deficient supply for a range of appliances and industrial equipment, industry executives and an economist said. Intel, the semiconductor giant, warned on July 23 that the shortages that have jacked up the price of some electronic items can extend into 2023. The automotive sector has suffered the most this year but supply to the sector could improve relatively soon, with China taking up some production demand that Taiwan could not meet, said ING Greater China chief economist Iris Pang. Taiwanese semiconductor companies have boosted production in China as blackouts and ongoing COVID-19 social distancing measures disrupted factory output and port operations in Taiwan, she said. \"China gained 5 percent on the chip shortage in terms of GDP - Taiwan semiconductor companies have planned well and built large factories in mainland China,\" Pang said, predicting that smartphone makers will be the next segment to face disruptions. \"Taiwanese semiconductor companies are tailoring making chips for autos, so the chip shortage should be solved for autos in a few weeks, but other electronics' chip shortage problem persists,\" Pang said, adding that could delay shipments of some new model smartphones.

The automobile industry is being hit hard by a shortage of computer chips that has slowed production and is set to drag on for months. Carmakers and suppliers have turned in strong results that beat expectations for the first half of the year, but they warned that a lack of semiconductors had crimped production. Microchips are essential for the electronics systems of modern cars, and have been in short supply since the end of last year. The situation is to some extent the fault of carmakers, who scaled back orders when the pandemic hit, so chipmakers shifted output to consumer electronics, which was seeing a boom in demand as people splurged on equipment to work and relax and home. That left carmakers in a tight situation as demand returned, with many slowing or even temporarily halting production at factories. While automakers and analysts were initially confident the impact would be short-lived and limited, they now see it as lasting through the rest of the year and the impact as more significant. Jaguar Land Rover has warned the chip shortage could cut its third-quarter output by half. The Volkswagen Group said the impact was likely to be \"more pronounced\" in the third quarter as it lowered its annual production forecast by roughly 450,000 vehicles.

Senate has overwhelmingly approved a bill that aims to boost US semiconductor production and the development of artificial intelligence and other technology in the face of growing international competition, most notably from China. The 68-32 vote for the bill on Tuesday demonstrates how confronting China economically is an issue that unites both parties in Congress. That's a rarity in an era of division as pressure grows on Democrats to change Senate rules to push past Republican opposition and gridlock. The centerpiece of the bill is a $50 billion emergency allotment to the Commerce Department to stand up semiconductor development and manufacturing through research and incentive programmes previously authorised by Congress. The bill's overall cost would increase spending by about $250 billion with most of the spending occurring in the first five years. Reservations about its costs Supporters described it as the biggest investment in scientific research that the country has seen in decades.

Shares of Indian food delivery giant Zomato soared on its market debut, following a $1.3 billion IPO, the country's biggest this year. Around 30 Indian companies have announced plans to list shares this year, with start-ups attracting billions of dollars in investment even though many are yet to make a profit. Zomato, which counts subsidiaries of Chinese tycoon Jack Ma's Ant Group and Uber among its shareholders, dominates India's booming app-based food-delivery space alongside rival Swiggy. Worst recession since independence in 1947 Its shares debuted at $1.54 on the Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensex Index, 51 percent higher than its issue price after its IPO was subscribed 40.38 times at the end of last week.

India's economy has taken a battering during the pandemic, recording its worst annual recession since independence in 1947. But its start-up sector has been a rare bright spot. This year alone, around 20 \"unicorns\" \u2014 firms valued at more than a billion dollars \u2014 have been created, including half a dozen in four days in April. Many are struggling to recruit qualified employees, with some reportedly offering incentives such as free motorbikes and tickets to cricket matches to lure talent. This year is set to be India's best for IPOs. Others set to list include digital payments firm Paytm, backed by Japan's SoftBank and Ma. Many of the start-ups, though, are loss-making. Zomato for instance, which operates in 525 Indian cities, is yet to turn profitable and reported a loss of $109.5M in the financial year ending March 2021. \"We are going to relentlessly focus on 10 years out and beyond, and are not going to alter our course for short-term profits at the cost of long-term success of the company,\" Zomato's chief executive Deepinder Goyal said on Friday."}

Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline, which supplies roughly half the fuel consumed on the East Coast, temporarily shut down its operations on May 7 after a gang of criminal hackers known as DarkSide broke into its computer system. 'Extortionists will never see this money' Colonial officials have said they took their pipeline system offline before the attack could spread to its operating system, and decided to pay a roughly $4.4 million ransom in hopes of bringing itself back online as soon as it could. The 63.7 bitcoin ransom \u2014 a favoured currency of hackers because of the perception that it is more difficult to trace \u2014 is currently valued at $2.3 million. \"The extortionists will never see this money,\" said Stephanie Hinds, the acting US attorney for the Northern District of California, where the seizure warrant was filed. The FBI generally discourages the payment of ransom, fearing it could encourage additional hacks.

G7 leaders have adopted a rival plan to oppose China's Belt and Road Initiative by helping build infrastructure in poorer nations in a \"values-driven, high-standard and transparent\" partnership. The adoption of the US-inspired \"Build Back Better World\" (B3W) project came after President Joe Biden and leaders met to address \"strategic competition with China and commit to concrete actions to help meet the tremendous infrastructure need in low- and middle-income countries\", the White House said. China has been widely criticised for saddling small countries with unmanageable debt as part of its trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which has seen money lent for projects stretching across Asia, Africa, Latin America and even Europe. President Xi Jinping launched the BRI in 2013 to significantly expand China's economic and political influence, with many of the infrastructure plans seen as helping deliver its goods globally. China denies any ulterior motives to the vast investment project. But critics argue it uses the financial leverage arising from the scheme to boost its clout, in what they dub \"debt-trap diplomacy\". READ MORE: G7 summit kicks off with virus, global economy and climate driving agenda The anti-BRI The White House said the G7 initiative would be similarly global in scope, estimating that the developing world needs more than $40 trillion in infrastructure, a gap \"which has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic\". \"B3W will collectively catalyse hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment for low- and middle-income countries in the coming years,\" it said. Funding will emphasise the environment and climate, labour safeguards, transparency, and anti-corruption, it added, in implicit contrast to China's opaque funding. Further details would come in the G7 summit's final communique on Sunday, the White House added. The issue is close to home for the elite club of wealthy democracies.

Britain has accused European Union leaders of holding the \"offensive\" view that Northern Ireland is not fully part of the United Kingdom, as Brexit cast a shadow over the Group of Seven summit. British media reported on Sunday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked French President Emmanuel Macron when they met Saturday in the English seaside resort of Carbis Bay how he would feel if sausages from Toulouse could not be moved to Paris. They said Macron replied the comparison did not work because Paris and Tolouse were part of the same country. The French presidency did not deny Macron had made the comments. It said he was explaining \u201cthat Toulouse and Paris were on a geographical unity of territory, Northern Ireland is on an island. The president wanted to stress that the situation was quite different and that it\u2019s not appropriate to hold that kind of comparison.\u201d Britain and the EU are in a spat over post-Brexit trade arrangements that could see British sausages banned from entering Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK that borders the 27-nation bloc.

Market dealers said the Lebanese pound was trading at around 15,150 to the dollar, losing around 90 percent of what it was worth in late 2019, when Lebanon's economic and financial crisis erupted. Lebanon is in the throes of a deep economic meltdown that is threatening its stability. The World Bank has called it one of the deepest depressions of modern history. The last time the pound hit a low of 15,000 in March protesters took to the streets across Lebanon for over a week, blocking roads by burning tyres.

The EU has said that it will set up a stand-alone agency to crack down on money laundering across Europe where major banks have been hit by a wave of dirty money scandals. Many cases have involved northern countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Finland with a reputation for playing by the rules, but criminal gangs and terrorism are also a central concern. Revelations often involve bank subsidiaries based in the EU's Baltic states, through which rich Russians evading taxes and sanctions have allegedly illegally funnelled money. The European Commission said the patchwork of regulation by national authorities was no longer effective and called for the creation of a new central entity, the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA). \"It's no longer enough for member states to do separately what they are doing (to fight money laundering).

Activists, journalists and politicians around the world have been spied on using cellphone malware developed by a private Israeli firm, reports said, igniting fears of widespread privacy and rights abuses. The use of the software, called Pegasus and developed by Israel's NSO group, was reported on by the Washington Post , the Guardian , Le Monde and other news outlets who collaborated on an investigation into a data leak. The leak was of a list of up to 50,000 phone numbers believed to have been identified as people of interest by clients of NSO since 2016, the reports said. Not all of those numbers were subsequently hacked, and the news outlets with access to the leak said more details about those who were compromised would be released in coming days. Among the numbers on the list are those of journalists for media organisations around the world including Agence France-Presse, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, The New York Times, Al Jazeera, France 24, Radio Free Europe, Mediapart, El Pa\u00eds, the Associated Press, Le Monde, Bloomberg, the Economist, Reuters and Voice of America, the Guardian said.

Carbon emissions are set to hit an all-time high by 2023 as just two percent of pandemic recovery finance is being spent on clean energy, the International Energy Agency has said. Countries have allocated more than $16 trillion (14 trillion euros) in fiscal support throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, mostly in the form of emergency financial help for workers and businesses. The IEA's Sustainable Recovery Tracker found that just $380 billion of this had been provided for clean energy projects. If all spending plans were to be realised, the intergovernmental body said on Tuesday, global carbon emissions would hit record levels in 2023 and continue to rise in the following years. Overall carbon pollution would be 3.5 billion tonnes higher than a scenario in which economies are compliant with the 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature goal of the Paris climate deal, it said. \"Since the Covid-19 crisis erupted, many governments may have talked about the importance of building back better for a cleaner future, but many of them are yet to put their money where their mouth is,\" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.

Chinese tech giant Huawei says it will launch a long-awaited new operating system for smartphones next week, part of an all-out push into the software industry aimed at weathering US sanctions and taking on Google's Android. Huawei tipped the June 2 launch of its HarmonyOS platform in a short teaser on social media, just as an internal memo came to light in which company founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei outlined plans to go big in software. The 76-year-old assured staff that on Tuesday \"in the software domain, the US will have very little control over our future development, and we have much autonomy.\" Huawei's plans are the latest signs of a radical transformation at the Shenzhen-based company, which is moving quickly into new product lines seen as less vulnerable to US pressure and a refocus on its core domestic market. Former US President Donald Trump in 2018 launched an aggressive US campaign to isolate Huawei when he was president, saying its networking equipment installed worldwide could be used by China's Communist Party for espionage or sabotage. The world's largest maker of telecom networking gear was barred from the huge American market and cut off from global component supply chains. Access to Google's Android operating system was also forbidden, and Washington has pressured allies to ban or rip out Huawei gear from their telecom networks. The Android curbs have threatened to torpedo Huawei's smartphone business, once in the global top three along with Samsung and Apple, forcing it to create HarmonyOS. Analysts warn that creating a successful new mobile operating system is exceedingly difficult in a world where Android and iOS are firmly entrenched, and next Wednesday's launch will be watched closely by the tech world. Huawei gave no further details on the launch other than the timing. A move into software is prudent for Huawei, which remains years away from developing chips needed for its own devices, said Marc Einstein, Chief Analyst at IRT Corporation in Tokyo.

A Japan court has sentenced an American father-son duo who helped former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn flee the country to between 20 months and two years in prison. Former US special forces operative Michael Taylor on Monday was sentenced to two years, while his son Peter received a sentence of 20 months. The Taylors did not contest the allegations against them, admitting their role in the audacious escape that left Ghosn an international fugitive in Lebanon. They had been facing up to three years in prison over the escape, which US prosecutors described as \"one of the most brazen and well-orchestrated escape acts in recent history\". READ MORE: American father, son admit to helping Carlos Ghosn flee Japan Remorse The pair had both apologised in previous hearings, expressing remorse for helping Ghosn jump bail as he awaited trial in 2019. Japanese prosecutors said earlier this month they were seeking a sentence of two years, 10 months for Michael, and two years, six months for Peter. Their defence lawyers had argued that a suspended sentence was appropriate given their remorse. They also argued that the pair's 10-month detention in the United States before extradition should be considered in sentencing. The Taylors arrived in Tokyo in March after losing their battle against extradition. At their first hearing, in June, prosecutors described the almost-cinematic details of the operation - including that Ghosn was hidden in a large case with air holes drilled into it to slip past security at an airport. He told the BBC recently about the experience, describing the half-hour in the box waiting for the plane to take off as \"probably the longest wait I've ever experienced in my life\". A third man, identified as George Antoine Zayek, is also accused of involvement in the escape but remains at large.

Messaging app giant WhatsApp has sued the Indian government seeking to defend its users' privacy and stop new rules that would require it to make messages \"traceable\" to external parties. WhatsApp filed the lawsuit on Wednesday in the Delhi High Court. It has argued that government rules regarding the traceability of messages are unconstitutional and undermine the fundamental right to privacy. The company currently uses end-to-end encryption for its messaging service, which encrypts messages in such a way that no one apart from the sender and receiver are able to read the messages sent between them.

A 90-day grace period for complying with the rules ended on Wednesday. Controversial regulations \"Civil society and technical experts around the world have consistently argued that a requirement to 'trace' private messages would break end-to-end encryption and lead to real abuse,\" WhatsApp said in a statement. \"WhatsApp is committed to protecting the privacy of people\u2019s personal messages and we will continue to do all we can within the laws of India to do so.\" The new regulations require internet platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to erase content authorities deem to be unlawful and to help with police investigations, including identifying the originators of \"mischievous information.\" The government said it would respond to the lawsuit.

The ByteDance-owned company added that over the next few weeks it will begin automatically removing some types of content that violate policy over minor safety, adult nudity and sexual activities, violent and graphic content and illegal activities and regulated goods. This will be in addition to the removals confirmed by the safety team. The company said this will help its safety team to concentrate more on highly contextual and nuanced areas, such as bullying and harassment, misinformation and hateful behavior. TikTok also added it will send a warning in the app upon first violation. However, in case of repeated violations, the user will be notified and the account can also be permanently removed.

On Saturday, the ministers also called on other countries to join them in the deal to achieve \"a more stable and fairer international tax architecture\". A framework for global tax reform, including a minimum corporate rate of 15 percent, was agreed by 131 countries earlier this month. It aims to prevent a race to the bottom as countries compete to offer the lowest tax rates to attract investment, with many multinationals as a result paying derisory levels of tax. \"If there is a deal today, there is no turning back. It will be implemented... it's a kind of tax revolution,\" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Saturday before the deal was agreed on. He earlier said that the minimum tax rate, which could be in place by 2023, \"must be ambitious\", with his country, the United States, and Germany among several nations pressing for a higher rate. But finance ministers and central bankers from the G20, the countries with the 19 biggest economies and the European Union, are not expected to go further than the 15 percent agreed on July 1.

Google's Android operating system and Google Play app store dominate the Italian market, and the authority said the firm abused its market position by blocking an Enel X app for users of electric vehicles. The regulator added on Thursday that it would require Google to make Enel X's app available on Android Auto, which mirrors features of an Android device, such as a smartphone, on a car dashboard screen. \"We respectfully disagree with the authority\u2019s decision and we will review our options,\" a Google spokesman said in a statement. He added that some apps are not supported on the Android Auto platform \"based on driver-distraction tests and regulatory and industry standards\".

US cyber security firm Recorded Future said that Darkside had admitted in a web post that it lost access to certain servers used for its web blog and for payments.

Recorded Future reported that the Darkside operator also said cryptocurrency ransom payments had been withdrawn from its server, dealing a setback to the group which had marketed itself as a formal business for hijacking victims' IT systems until they paid to unlock them. Speculation focused on who could have taken down Darkside's computers after it had spent the past half-year extorting millions of dollars from companies which fell victim to its ransomware. Some suspected that the US military's Cyber Command took action, pointing to the Twitter account of the Pentagon's 780th Military Intelligence Brigade, a hacking unit that retweeted the Recorded Future report shortly after it came out.

Qatar Finance Minister Ali Sherif al Emadi has been arrested for questioning over allegations of embezzlement, abuse of power and crimes related to the public sector, according to a statement carried by state news agency QNA. An investigation is under way, the statement added. Emadi has been minister of finance in the wealthy Gulf Arab state since 2013 and sits on the board of its powerful $300 billion sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority. He is also chairman of the board of directors of Qatar National Bank, the largest lender in the Middle East and Africa. Economic policies during oil price crash Emadi steered Qatar's economic policies during the 2014-2015 oil price crash that prompted the tiny nation \u2014 as well as other Gulf countries \u2014 to accelerate plans to diversify the economy. Qatar, a leading producer of liquefied natural gas, saw its economy shrink by 3.7 percent last year due to the coronavirus crisis and lower global energy demand. The contraction, however, was smaller than expected and the smallest in the Gulf region, according to International Monetary Fund data.

A total of 130 countries have agreed to a global tax reform ensuring that multinationals pay their fair share wherever they operate, but the deal falls short of addressing the concern of some developing countries. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said on Thursday that global companies, including US behemoths Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple would be taxed at a rate of at least 15 percent once the deal is implemented. The new tax regime will add some $150 billion to government coffers globally once it comes into force by 2023. However, most of the benefit of this global minimum tax goes to the rich countries. \"The framework updates key elements of the century-old international tax system, which is no longer fit for purpose in a globalised and digitalised 21st century economy,\" the OECD said.

For decades large multinational companies have moved their profits to tax havens such as Ireland. In the digital era, the flight of profits increased as tech firms used the pretext of intellectual property to ferry away profits from the countries where the products or services are sold. The main purpose of the minimum corporate tax is to ensure that companies pay a fair share of tax in countries where they sell products and services - not just where the headquarters is located. The 130 countries that have backed the agreement represent more than 90 percent of global GDP. These countries include India, Pakistan, and Turkey. New rules on where the biggest multinationals are taxed would shift taxing rights on more than $100 billion of profits to countries where the profits are earned. The minimum corporate tax does not"}

Apple faces one of its most serious legal threats in recent years: A trial that threatens to upend its iron control over its app store, which brings in billions of dollars each year while feeding more than 1.6 billion iPhones, iPads, and other devices. The federal court case is being brought by Epic Games, maker of the popular video game Fortnite. Epic wants to topple the so-called \u201cwalled garden\u201d of the app store, which Apple started building 13 years ago as part of a strategy masterminded by co-founder Steve Jobs. Epic charges that Apple has transformed a once-tiny digital storefront into an illegal monopoly that squeezes mobile apps for a significant slice of their earnings. Apple takes a commission of 15 percent to 30 percent on purchases made within apps, including everything from digital items in games to subscriptions. Apple denies Epic\u2019s claims. Apple's highly successful formula has helped turn the iPhone maker into one of the world\u2019s most profitable companies, one with a market value that now tops $2.2 trillion. Privately held Epic is puny by comparison, with an estimated market value of $30 billion. Its aspirations to get bigger hinge in part on its plan to offer an alternative app store on the iPhone.

Unlike previous Baidu autonomous driving demonstrations in Beijing, this is the first time that no one is behind the wheel, but a safety member is sitting in the front passenger seat in case of emergency. Running in an area of about 3 square kilometres, about 10 Apollo taxis pick up and drop off passengers at eight stops in western Beijing's Shougang Park. Each ride costs $4.6 (30 yuan). The park is an old site of iron and steel plants and has been transformed into a sightseeing spot and venue for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics Games. Although there is no heavy traffic flow, an influx of tourists were seen in the park on the second day of Labor Day holiday. The robotaxis were repeatedly forced to brake when encountering jaywalkers or curious tourists who came very close to the vehicles for photos. Book your taxi using apps Passengers can call a robotaxi on Apollo Go apps. When the taxi arrives, passengers verify their identities and scan a health code before getting in. The taxi will start to move after detecting that passengers have fastened their seat belts. Passenger Kelly Wang and her husband said they had a smooth riding experience. But Amy Li said she still has concerns about autonomous driving. She added that her mother was not allowed to try it because it is only open to people above 18 and under 60 years old. Baidu, known for its search engines, has been testing autonomous driving on the open roads since last year.

A report released by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation finds that the global pandemic has brought severe implications on the lives of women. According to the report, in 2020, one in every 20 women across the globe lost their jobs. That makes 64 million women in total who have been left without a chance to provide for their families and contribute to their local economies. The report also sheds a light on a global pattern in which more women have lost their jobs compared to men in nearly every country. That, the report says, is partly due to the fact that 40 percent of employed women work in sectors like retail, manufacturing and business sectors that have been devastated by the pandemic. Women have also faced challenges at home. As educational institutions closed globally, the amount of time women spend with caregiving significantly increased. The report says women are spending five more hours per week on child care than they did before the pandemic. That means 31 hours of the week spent by women on childcare during 2020. The research claims that national economies shrink when women are left out, highlighting that existing gender gaps in OECD countries are costing economies 15 percent of their GDP.

Bernard Madoff, who was convicted for running the largest known Ponzi scheme in history, has died in federal prison where he was serving a 150-year sentence, the Bureau of Prisons said. Madoff died at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina early on Wednesday, apparently from natural causes, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The person was not authorised to speak publicly and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. Last year, Madoff's lawyers filed court papers to try to get the 82-year-old released from prison in the Covid-19 pandemic, saying he had suffered from end-stage renal disease and other chronic medical conditions. The request was denied. A criminal legacy Madoff admitted swindling thousands of clients out of billions of dollars in investments over decades. A court-appointed trustee has recovered more than $13 billion of an estimated $17.5 billion that investors put into Madoff\u2019s business. At the time of Madoff's arrest, fake account statements were telling clients they had holdings worth $60 billion. For decades, Madoff enjoyed an image as a self-made financial guru whose Midas touch defied market fluctuations. A former chairperson of the Nasdaq stock market, he attracted a devoted legion of investment clients \u2013 from Florida retirees to celebrities such as famed film director Steven Spielberg, actor Kevin Bacon and Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. But his investment advisory business was exposed in 2008 as a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme that wiped out people\u2019s fortunes and ruined charities and foundations. He became so hated he had to wear a bulletproof vest to court. Madoff pleaded guilty in March 2009 to securities fraud and other charges, saying he was \u201cdeeply sorry and ashamed.\u201d After several months living under house arrest at his $7 million Manhattan penthouse apartment, he was led off to jail in handcuffs to scattered applause from angry investors in the courtroom. \u201cHe stole from the rich.

{"title": "What is behind the global chip crisis?", "content": "The pandemic has altered people\u2019s habits, causing a surge in demand for home electronic devices. This has swept the global chip supply and disrupted automobile manufacturing. The pandemic has led to the global shortage of semiconductors or chips, and now the auto industry is reeling from being affected by this crisis, too. With chips needed in mobile phones, game consoles, and TVs, the global auto industry is also dependent on them. South Korea\u2019s giant automobile maker, Hyundai Motor Co, said on Tuesday that it plans to temporarily suspend production at its Ulsan No.1 plant in South Korea due to chip and component supply issues from April 7-14. \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation to take prompt and necessary measures and optimize production in line with the supply conditions,\u201d Hyundai said in a statement. Toyota\u2019s Czech unit, Toyota Motor Manufacturing Czech Republic, has already announced its decision to halt production in Kolin, east of Prague, for two weeks due to the same reason. It is not only car manufacturers - other tech companies that manufacture TVs, computers, game consoles, and mobile phones, have also been experiencing the negative effects of the crisis. What chip shortage means for auto industry The automobile industry has become increasingly dependent on semiconductors for various features within cars, from driver-assistance to emergency braking. Auto electronics, which includes everything from LCD screens to in-car systems, are set to account for 45 percent of a car's production cost by 2030, according to a Deloitte report . The cost of semiconductor-based components used in these electronics is projected to rise to $475 in 2020, and $600 in 2030. The chip crisis has forced many automobile giants, Volkswagen AG, Nissan Motor Co, General Motors, and Ford, to curtail the production of less profitable vehicles. Now, millions of cars that are almost finished, except for the chips that would complete them, are waiting for these integral, tiny semiconductors. Automakers used about $40 billion of chips in 2018, according to Digitimes Research, and demand is increasing. Moreover, fully electric vehicles need twice as much, while self-driving ones will use far more. According to"}

Volkswagen of America has issued false statements this week saying it would change its brand name to \"Voltswagen,\" to stress its commitment to electric vehicles, only to reverse course and admit that the supposed name change was a joke. Mark Gillies, a company spokesman, confirmed on Tuesday that the statement had been a pre-April Fool's Day joke after having insisted on Monday that the release was legitimate and the name change accurate. The company's false statement was distributed again on Tuesday, saying the brand-name change reflected a shift to more battery-electric vehicles.

Increasing the tax-free sum that grandparents will pass on to grandchildren may be contentious, as it would only favour families that are rich enough to benefit from the initiative.

Satellite data from MarineTraffic.com confirmed that the ship was moving away from the shoreline toward the centre of the artery.

The number of electric and hybrid cars in use in Turkey has increased by 150 percent compared to last year, reaching 44,291, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute. These cleaner machines, which emit fewer carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels, have been increasing steadily over the past 10 years. In 2011, there were only 47 such vehicles registered in Turkey. Five years later, their numbers increased by a thousand for the first time and rose to around 15,000 in 2019. The number of registered electric and hybrid cars was 17,749 in February 2020 - it reached 36,487 by the end of the year. This has increased again: the number of cars in question was recorded as 44,291 at the end of February 2021, a 150 percent increase compared to the same period last year. However, despite a considerable increase in their presence on the roads, the overall share of these cleaner vehicles in the market remains low. As of the end of February, only 0.3 percent of the registered 13,214,599 cars were electric or hybrid. The rate of electric or hybrid vehicles (9.1 percent) among new registered cars, exceeded the rate of LPG fuelled cars (4.9 percent) for the first time in February. Last month, 3,885 electric or hybrid cars and 2,79 LPG-fuelled cars were registered in traffic. Electric car technology While a \"green transformation\" has accelerated in many areas from industry to the services sector, these developments have led the world's leading automotive companies to accelerate investments in electric car production. In the European Union, sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars almost tripled, passing a million vehicles. The data released by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) showed that sales of fully-electric and plug-in hybrids surged to 1.046 million vehicles from 387,808 in 2019.

Major firms including BNY Mellon, Mastercard Inc and Tesla Inc are among those to have embraced or invested in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin reached $62,377 on Tuesday, a huge gain of 114 percent since the start of the year. Growing market The cryptocurrency market has grown exponentially in 2021 and is now worth a staggering $2 trillion as it increasingly attracts interest from big names on Wall Street. On October 31, 2008, in the wake of the financial crisis, one or more anonymous people, hidden behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, published the founding white paper of bitcoin. The goal was to create a means of payment, the security of which would not be overseen by a central bank or financial organisations, but instead regulated by software with rules almost impossible to alter. While anybody can \"mine\" for new bitcoins, to do so requires giant data centres, leading to platforms such as Coinbase providing a way of trading in cryptocurrencies.

Coal's contribution to electricity generation in India fell for the second straight year in 2020, marking a departure from decades of growth in coal-fired power. Still, the fuel accounts for nearly three-fourths of India's annual power output. Environmental activists have long rallied against India adding new coal-fired capacity.

Foreign investors had their day in Japan as they succeeded in ousting Chairman of Toshiba, one of the oldest business conglomerates that makes multiple products ranging from power generators to computer hard drives. Osamu Nagayama, the 74-year-old director, could not get enough votes for a re-election at the company's annual general meeting (AGM) of the shareholders on Friday. His exit comes as Toshiba's management faces criticism for colluding with government in pushing back against overseas investors who own almost two-thirds of Toshiba's stock. The move against the board chair is particularly significant as management in Japanese companies usually holds unquestionable sway. Battered Toshiba has faced questions related to its corporate governance practice in the past especially after it emerged that former executives inflated profits to the tune of $1.3 billion between 2009 and 2014. After the AGM that lasted nearly three hours, Tokyo-based Toshiba failed to win shareholder approval for the reappointment of Nagayama and one other member of the board of directors. The other nine candidates were approved. Nagayama had come under pressure to resign after an independent investigation that said Toshiba officials colluded with the Japanese government to curb foreign investors\u2019 influence at last year's shareholder meeting. Major shareholders such as Singapore-based investment fund Effissimo instigated that investigation, alleging that last year\u2019s meeting, in which Effissimo had nominated dissident directors, wasn\u2019t carried out fairly. They demanded Nagayama's ouster at Friday\u2019s meeting. \u201cHe bears the greatest responsibility in nominating candidates and has ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the board,\u201d Effissimo said in a report earlier this month.

The European Union has imposed wide-ranging economic sanctions on Belarus for the first time, targeting its main export industries and access to finance a month after it forced a Ryanair flight to land in Minsk. The measures taken on Thursday include banning EU businesses from importing goods or doing business with Belarusian companies in sectors including banking, petroleum products and potash, a salt used in fertiliser that is the country's main export. The sanctions are far stricter than measures imposed in the past, which mainly consisted of blacklists of Belarusian officials and had little or no impact on the behaviour of President Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994. READ MORE: EU calls RyanAir diversion by Belarus act of 'state piracy' Ryanair plane incident In the most significant measure for the Belarusian economy, the new sanctions ban EU companies from transporting potash. Belarus will now need to find other countries and ports to ship its top export via the Baltic Sea. Russian President Vladimir Putin is Lukashenko's closest ally but Russia does not have enough port capacity to handle Belarusian fertilisers or its own, data showed. EU leaders were outraged by the interception of the Ryanair plane flying between Athens and Vilnius on May 23. Belarusian authorities arrested a dissident journalist and his girlfriend after the plane landed, in an incident which Western countries branded state piracy. Lukashenko said the interception was justified to prevent a rebellion in Belarus. With Lukashenko so far impervious to foreign pressure over a presidential election which opponents say was rigged last August, and was followed by a crackdown on street protests, the EU had said it wanted to increase pressure. Diplomats said the decision to impose harsher sanctions was taken unusually quickly, reflecting the seriousness with which governments viewed the Ryanair incident.

We examine why. Americans seem to think the pandemic period that devastated the global economy is a good time to quit their jobs and look for new opportunities. Now a record number of people in the country are resigning, creating a record number of job openings in the US. According to The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey report , some 4 million people quit their jobs in April, and the trend seems to be going strong. The report also showed that the layoffs hit a record low in April. Anecdotal evidence and data suggest that people are interested in seeking different career paths, which could be the result of self-reflection during the pandemic. Now there's a stronger desire to have a better life-work balance. Millions of unemployed Americans remain at home because of trouble securing child care, generous unemployment benefits, and lingering fears over COVID-19 even as vaccines are widely accessible and the pandemic is subsiding. \"The evidence continues to grow that the lacklustre job creation of recent months is a result of constraints on labour supply and that the labour market is tight,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. Job openings, a measure of labour demand, increased by 998,000 to 9.3 million on the last day of April, the highest level since the series began in December 2000. Vacancies rose in all four regions and were spread across nearly all industries as well as the government sector. Unfilled jobs in the accommodation and food services increased by 349,000.

Paraguay is in no hurry to make bitcoin a legal tender as previously thought. Lawmaker Carlos Rejala, who had inadvertently sparked the excitement with a tweet earlier in June, confirmed on Friday that he was pushing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies, not make them legal tender. For days, crypto currency supporters had wondered if Paraguay will become the second country in the world after another Latin American neighbour - El Salvador - announced that bitcoin can be used as money. The internet has been buzzing with rumors that Asuncion will follow suit. But centrist legislator Rejala said, \"It is a bill of digital assets and it differs from that of El Salvador because they are taking it as legal currency and in Paraguay it will be impossible to do something like that.\" Earlier in June, linking to a story about a local entertainment firm planning to accept cryptocurrencies, Rejala had tweeted: \"This is Paraguay. July we legislate! #Bitcoin\", which some media and twitter users had picked up on. The 36-year-old, who leads a small political party with a total of four seats in Congress, is now seeking to rally support to pass his bill regulating the digital assets. He is working on three drafts of the law he intends to present on July 14. El Salvador's gamble El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said on Thursday that a recently passed law making bitcoin legal tender will take effect on September 7, making the Central American nation the first country in the world to take such a step. Bukele has said he is confident the project will be a success and could be a \"leap forward for humanity\" even though the World Bank has declined to offer technical support and the International Monetary Fund has expressed concern.

Alphabet unit Google has found itself in the EU antitrust spotlight again as regulators opened an investigation into its lucrative digital advertising business to examine whether it favours its own business over rivals, advertisers and online publishers. Google generated $147 billion in revenue from online ads last year, more than any other company in the world.

Just before 1400 GMT on Tuesday, bitcoin sold for around $28,890, a level last seen at the beginning of the year, with analysts citing Chinese efforts to curb trading and mining operations. It later rebounded slightly to around $30,133 for a daily decline of 7.5 percent. It has lost about 50 percent of its value since hitting an all-time high of $64,870 in mid April. \"Concerns mount over China's ongoing clampdown and fears that widespread acceptance of bitcoin and other digital currencies will be delayed because of concerns about their environmental impact,\" noted analyst Fawad Razaqzada at trading site ThinkMarkets. Green backlash Bitcoin faces a green backlash because so-called mining often uses electricity produced from fossil fuels, especially coal, he noted. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are mined by solving puzzles using powerful computers that consume enormous amounts of electricity. China has now extended a crackdown on its massive cryptocurrency mining industry with a ban on mines in a key southwestern province. The science journal Nature recently published a study showing that Chinese bitcoin mines represented a risk to the country's climate goals. Chinese mines power nearly 80 percent of global trade in cryptocurrencies despite a domestic trading ban since 2017, but several provinces have recently ordered mines to close as Beijing considers the industry with a critical eye. Authorities in the province of Sichuan ordered the closure of 26 mines last week, according to a notice widely circulated on Chinese social media and confirmed by a former bitcoin miner.

Wading knee-deep in the calm waters of a lagoon, workers in northern Tunisia harvest red seaweed, in a nation dubbed a Mediterranean \"trailblazer\" in cultivating the in-demand plant. Red seaweed or algae is used for gelling, thickening and texturing agents that are increasingly a substitute for animal-based products in processed foods, and it is also being used increasingly in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The harvest, the Selt Marine company's first on an industrial scale, comes after years of research and a wait of more than two decades for authorisation to use the lagoons , said French-Tunisian entrepreneur Mounir Bouklout. Climate and water encourage the cultivation Several countries including nearby Morocco have seen their natural reserves of red seaweed diminish in recent years due to overexploitation. Instead near Bizerte, north of the Tunisian capital, 10 percent of what is harvested goes back into the water, said Bouklout, another seaweed expert. \"We wait for nature to do its work, and after 45 days we harvest it,\" Bouklout told AFP. Surrounded by hills topped with wind turbines, workers pull seaweed growing around cylindrical netting from the lagoon and bring it to shore. The plant matter, which ranges from green to dark red in colour, is separated, dried in the sun and taken to a factory to be turned into substances such as agar-agar. The sought-after red variety is mainly grown in Asia, which is the world's biggest producer, consumer and exporter of seaweed. But Tunisia's waters and climate also favour its farming, which can encourage the development of local marine life including shellfish. Seaweed absorbs elements like nitrogen and phosphorous, so growing it is also a way of \"naturally cleaning the lagoon\", Bouklout said.

It includes bookmark folders for organising saved content; an \"Undo tweet\" feature that gives users 30 seconds to cancel a sent tweet before it appears; a \"reader mode\" that makes threaded tweets easier to read; and customisable app icons and colour themes. Subscribers will also get dedicated customer support, meaning issues they report could get attention faster than other users. READ MORE: Twitter fixes issue with Tweets shared via WhatsApp amid rumours Attraction features The subscription costs 3.50 Canadian dollars ($2.89) a month and 4.50 Australian dollars ($3.45). There's no timeline for rolling out the service in other countries. Twitter has been adding new features to attract new users. The social media site has nearly 200 million daily users, fewer than other social media networks. Facebook had 1.88 billion daily users on average in March 2021. Snapchat, meanwhile, had 280 million average daily active users in the first quarter. READ MORE: Twitter flags thousands of 'misleading' US election tweets"}

The world's largest meat processing company has resumed most production after a weekend cyberattack, but experts say the vulnerabilities exposed by this attack and others are far from resolved. In a statement late on Wednesday, the FBI attributed the attack on Brazil-based meat processor JBS SA to REvil, a Russian-speaking gang that has made some of the largest ransomware demands on record in recent months. The FBI said it will work to bring the group to justice and it urged anyone who is the victim of a cyberattack to contact the bureau immediately. REvil has not posted anything related to the hack on its dark web site. But that\u2019s not unusual. Ransomware syndicates as a rule don\u2019t post about attacks when they are in initial negotiations with victims \u2014 or if the victims have paid a ransom. In October, a REvil representative who goes by the handle \u201cUNKN\u201d said in an interview published online that the agriculture sector would now be a main target for the syndicate. REvil also threatened to auction off sensitive stolen data from victims who refused to pay it. The attack targeted servers supporting JBS\u2019s operations in North America and Australia. Backup servers weren\u2019t affected and the company said it was not aware of any customer, supplier or employee data being compromised.

Mexico's Ministry of Culture said in a statement Friday that it had sent letters signed by Mexico's Culture Minister Alejandra Frausto to all three global companies, asking each for a \"public explanation on what basis it could privatise collective property.\" The Ministry of Culture says Zara, owned by Inditex, the world's largest clothing retailer, used a pattern distinctive to the indigenous Mixteca community of San Juan Colorado in the southern state of Oaxaca. Anthropologie, owned by URBN, used a design developed by the indigenous Mixe community of Santa Maria Tlahuitoltepec, while Patowl copied a pattern from the indigenous Zapoteco community in San Antonino Castillo Velasco, both in the state of Oaxaca, according to the Ministry of Culture. No immediate comment from companies URBN, Inditex, and Patowl could not be immediately reached for comment. The extent to which fashion designers have profited from incorporating cultural designs without acknowledging their origins or fairly compensating communities has been a point of contention in recent years. In 2019, the Mexican government accused fashion house Carolina Herrera of cultural appropriation of indigenous patterns and textiles from Mexico in its collection. Neither Carolina Herrera nor its parent company, Puig, could be immediately reached for comment. In 2019, Herrera's creative director Wes Gordon reportedly said in a statement in 2019 that the collection \"pays tribute to the richness of Mexican culture.\""}

Biden had already announced his major budget initiatives, but during a rollout on Friday he will release them as a single proposal to incorporate them into the government's existing budget framework, including Social Security and Medicare. That provides a fuller view of the administration's fiscal posture. Democratic aides disclosed key elements of the Biden plan, speaking on condition of anonymity because the document is not yet public. Tax increases expected in the budget rollout include hiking the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent, increasing capital gains rates on top earners and returning the top personal income tax bracket to 39.6 percent. The whopping deficit projections reflect a government whose steadily accumulating pile of debt has topped $28 trillion after well more than $5 trillion in Covid-19 relief. The government's structural deficit remains unchecked, and Biden is using tax hikes on businesses and the wealthy to power huge new social programmes like universal prekindergarten and large subsidies for child care. What does the 'tax and spend' budget include The political arguments over Biden's ambitious proposals are quickly distilling into a debate over the size and scope of what all sides agree are sorely needed upgrades to the nation's ageing and outmoded infrastructure. The budget incorporates the administration's eight-year, $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal and its $1.8 trillion American Families Plan and adds details on his $1.5 trillion request for annual operating appropriations for the Pentagon and domestic agencies.

Researchers from Cambridge University, the University of East Anglia and London-based SOAS looked at a \"realistic scenario\" known as RCP 8.5, where carbon and other polluting emissions continue rising in coming decades. They then looked at how the likely negative impact of rising temperatures, sea levels and other climate change effects on countries' economies and finances might affect their credit ratings. \"We find that 63 sovereigns suffer climate-induced downgrades of approximately 1.02 notches by 2030, rising to 80 sovereigns facing an average downgrade of 2.48 notches by 2100,\" the study released on Thursday said.

Shares have risen in Europe after a mixed session in Asia as China reported a variety of data that painted a complicated picture of its recovery from the pandemic. The passage of a $1.9 trillion aid package for the US economy has added to investor confidence that the US and global economy will likely experience a strong recovery from the pandemic in the second half of the year but also potentially increase the rate of inflation. Markets got a mixed message from the data out of China on Monday, which has led the global recovery, reopening earlier than other countries from coronavirus shut-downs that emerged in the central city of Wuhan in early 2020. Retail sales jumped nearly 36 percent year-on-year in January-February from a year earlier. But the surge was mostly driven by strong demand for cars, catering and jewelry, suggesting Chinese consumers were splashing out during the Lunar New Year, ING economists said in a report. The data were exaggerated by low base effects from the shutdowns last year, they said. Industrial output in the first two months was up almost 17 percent from the corresponding period in 2019, authorities said. \"We expect activity to remain strong in the near-term, as the easing of virus restrictions boosts consumption and fiscal stimulus among key trading partners should keep exports strong,\" said Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard.

In a few days, both sides will reveal the technical annexes to the deal, according to the Financial Times newspaper (FT). Brussels is scheduled to ratify this in early 2022. But the market-access deal has opposition inside and outside the EU for various reasons, ranging from a global power struggle between the US and China, to Beijing\u2019s despicable human rights records. With the deal, the EU hopes to extend its access across the Chinese market as it was secured by the former Trump administration for US companies operating in China under \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade deal. For top European officials, the deal is aimed at bringing the EU on par with the US in trade relations with China. On the other hand, for Beijing, the market-access deal is a strategic move that increases divisions between the EU and the US, according to experts. As a result, some former American officials view the deal as a diplomatic victory for China, displacing Washington\u2019s displeasure toward the investment agreement. \u201cBy any measure it\u2019s a setback.

The trial of two Americans accused of helping former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn escape from Japan while out on bail will open on June 14, the Tokyo District Court says. Michael Taylor and his son Peter are accused of hiding Ghosn in a music box so he could flee to Lebanon in late 2019. The Taylors have been denied bail at the Tokyo Detention Center and not available for comment. Ghosn, arrested in 2018, was awaiting trial on financial misconduct allegations, including underreporting his compensation and breach of trust in diverting Nissan Motor Co. money for personal gain, when he fled. He says he is innocent. Japan has no extradition treaty with Lebanon, but has one with the US, which extradited the Taylors last month after the US Supreme Court rejected their appeal. READ MORE: US extradites two alleged Carlos Ghosn accomplices to Japan Accused of helping criminal Michael Taylor, with the help of another man, George-Antoine Zayek, hid Ghosn in a large box, which passed through airport security in Osaka, central Japan, and was loaded onto a private jet that flew to Turkey, according to Japanese authorities. Peter Taylor is accused of meeting with Ghosn and helping carry out the escape. The Taylors were paid at least $1.3 million, authorities say. The Taylors argued in the US courts they did not commit a crime because jumping bail is technically not a crime in Japan. Tokyo prosecutors have said they are accused of helping a criminal escape and violating immigration regulations. They face up to three years in prison if convicted. Although prospects for Ghosn facing trial in Japan are dim, Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive and an American, is standing trial in Tokyo on charges of underreporting Ghosn\u2019s compensation. He has denied the charges. Ghosn, credited with successfully leading Nissan for two decades, was worried about a possible public reaction"}

What\u2019s not to like about it? With the global pandemic turning the working world on its head and triggering an unprecedented wave of unemployment, a mindset shift around what counts as \u2018work\u2019 and work-life balance has begun to take centre stage. Times of crises, after all, have a tendency of challenging entrenched dogmas and systems, thrusting once radical ideas into the realm of possibility. One of them is the four-day week. With more people operating from their homes than ever before, revolutionary working practices are becoming more feasible and some are calling to take advantage of this new window of flexibility to rethink how we conceptualise work. In The Case for a Four-Day Week , authored by researchers from the New Economic Foundation think tank, a shorter workweek should be at the heart of a post-pandemic recovery. But are we ready to bury the five-day, 9-to-5 grind and usher in a shorter workweek? \u201cTwo years ago, most businesses would say no, you couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d entrepreneur and philanthropist Andrew Barnes, one of the pioneers behind the four-day week, told TRT World . \u201cWhat the pandemic has done is shown us that the traditional model is not necessary for the operation of business. It challenged the fallacy of time in the office being equated with productivity.\u201d One of the problems with the pandemic-induced \u2018working-from-home\u2019 approach is that hours are getting longer, said Barnes, adding that the four-day week would function as a much needed \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d.

And with more disposable time, people are less likely to indulge in unhealthy convenience foods or carbon-intensive activities. A four-day model would see 560 million fewer miles being driven every week, making a measurable impact on pollution. Being chronically overworked is an increasingly common affliction.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are minted by solving puzzles using powerful computers that consume enormous amounts of electricity, much of it produced by coal plants. The Nature study found that unchecked, China's bitcoin mines will generate 130.50 million metric tons of carbon emissions by 2024, close to the annual greenhouse gas emissions from Italy or oil-rich Saudi Arabia.

This involves minting new coins and keeping track of cryptocurrency transactions. About 40 percent of China's bitcoin mines are powered with coal, while the rest use renewables, the study said. But the coal-guzzling rigs are so large they could end up undermining Beijing's pledge to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060, it warned. \"The intensive bitcoin blockchain operation in China can quickly grow as a threat that could potentially undermine the emission reduction effort,\" co-author Wang Shouyang from the Chinese Academy of Sciences told AFP.

Alibaba Group, the world\u2019s biggest e-commerce company, has been fined $2.8 billion by Chinese regulators for anti-competitive tactics, as it tightens control over fast-growing tech industries. Beijing is worried about the dominance of the country's biggest internet companies including Alibaba at a time when the industry is expanding into finance, health services and other sensitive areas. The government says anti-monopoly enforcement, especially in tech industries, is a priority this year. Alibaba was fined for \u201cabusing its dominant position\u201d to limit competition by retailers that use its platforms and hindering the \u201cfree circulation\u201d of goods, the State Administration for Market Regulation announced. It said the fine was equal to 4% of its total 2019 sales of $69.5 billion. READ MORE: China denies plan to hit Alibaba with $1B fine A new setback The move is a new setback for Alibaba and its billionaire founder, Jack Ma, following a November decision by regulators to suspend the stock market debut of Ant Group, a finance platform spun off from the e-commerce giant. It would have been the world's biggest initial public stock offering last year. Ma, one of China's richest and most prominent entrepreneurs, disappeared temporarily from public view after criticising regulators in a November speech. That was followed days later by the Ant Group suspension, though finance specialists said regulators already had been worried Ant lacked adequate financial risk controls. Alibaba, launched in 1999, operates retail, business-to-business and consumer-to-consumer platforms. It has expanded at a breakneck pace into financial services, film production and other fields. Twelve companies including Tencent Holdings, which operates games and the popular WeChat messaging service, were fined $77,000 each in March on charges of failing to disclose previous acquisitions and other deals. In February, the government issued anti-monopoly guidelines aimed at preventing anti-competitive practices such as signing exclusive agreements with merchants and use of subsidies to squeeze out competitors. Regulators said in December they were looking into possibly anti-competitive tactics by Alibaba including a policy dubbed \u201cchoose one of two,\u201d which requires business"}

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has offered inventors $100 million in prize money to develop ways to fight global warming by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or ocean. \"Right now we've only got one planet,\" said Musk, CEO of electric carmaker Tesla Inc. \"Even a 0.1 percent chance of disaster \u2013 why run that risk? That's crazy!\" In January, Musk announced his intention to offer $100 million in prizes and set out the contest rules on Thursday, Earth Day. What organisers called the \"largest incentive prize in history\" will last for four years through Earth Day, 2025. Carbon capture and storage has drawn growing interest as a warming climate has melted glaciers, intensified tropical storms and resulted in \"sunny day flooding\" of more and more coastal areas. While countries are working to reduce emissions, scientists say carbon removal technology will also be crucial to the goal of getting emissions to net zero by 2050. \"Both cost and scalability need to be addressed. Is it going to be enough carbon to matter, and can we afford it as a civilization? Those are two things that matter,\" Musk said on a video feed that showed him outdoors, barefoot in a black shirt with water and trees in the background. Target: 1,000 tonnes of CO2 removal Carbon capture projects have already drawn backing from Silicon Valley startups, public officials worried about the slow pace of cutting emissions, and emitters including oil companies seeking to offset their climate impacts. The technology is not yet commercially viable. Removing carbon can cost more than $300 per metric tonne in a world that each year emits greenhouse gases equivalent to about 50 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. By 2050, some 10 billion tonnes of carbon capture may be needed, by some estimates. \"I think this is one of those things that is going to take a while to figure out what the right solution is,\""}

Barcelona prosecutors have sued energy giant Endesa for the deaths of hundreds of birds electrocuted by its high-wire power lines. According to the lawsuit, a copy of which was seen by AFP on Wednesday, prosecutors are suing the utility for offences against the environment and wildlife. They say the company failed to adequately insulate its electricity cables and pylons, creating \"a death trap\" for birds. Electrocution occurs when birds touch two wires at a time or when they perch on a conductive pylon while also touching a cable. In their complaint, prosecutors said 255 birds died in the Osona region north of Barcelona between 2018 and 2020, including protected species such as white storks, griffon vultures, short-toed eagles and buzzards. \"The electrocution and death of birds due to direct contact with the exposed conductors on pylons owned by the defendant has affected the whole province of Barcelona, constituting a veritable plague,\" the complaint reads.

A short squeeze takes place when the price of a heavily shorted stock rises sharply, forcing short-sellers who had bet against the stock to buy it at those prices to avoid further losses. GameStop shares were up 54.5 percent in trading before the bell at $141.70 at 0630 ET. Headphone maker Koss Corp surged 57 percent, while cannabis company Sundial Growers rose 10 percent.

Facebook has said it will lift a contentious ban on Australian news pages, after the government agreed to amend a world-first media law fiercely opposed by the tech giant. The social media firm sparked global outrage last week by blacking out news for its Australian users and inadvertently blocking a series of non-news Facebook pages linked to everything from cancer charities to emergency response services. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, after a series of talks over the weekend, indicated a compromise had been reached on key aspects of a law that would force global tech companies to pay news companies for content that appears on their platforms. Australia will offer four amendments, including to the mechanism for final offer arbitration, which a Facebook executive told local media was a sticking point for the company. We are satisfied that the Australian government has agreed to a number of changes and guarantees that address our core concerns about allowing commercial deals that recognise the value our platform provides to publishers relative to the value we receive from them,\" Facebook said in a statement posted online. \"As a result of these changes, we can now work to further our investment in public interest journalism, and restore news on Facebook for Australians in the coming days,\" said Will Easton, managing director of Facebook Australia.

Before the latest downturn, the pound had briefly stabilised at 8,000-8,500 to the greenback in recent weeks. In July, it had reached 9,800 to the dollar.

No functional government On Monday, a central bank committee \"agreed on a roadmap with deadlines for the Bank of Lebanon to take appropriate measures\" if these requirements were not met, it said in a statement.

We look at what's at the heart of the controversies surrounding these laws. Why are Indian farmers protesting? For months, tens of thousands of farmers have been camped on the edge of New Delhi, seeking to repeal three new farm laws passed in September 2020. Farmers across India fear the laws will favour large agribusiness and corporations, reduce their earnings and leave them saddled with debt . What has been the government's response to protests? Protests have largely been peaceful but violence erupted on January 26, India's Republic Day, when tens of thousands of farmers riding tractors and horses and many marching on foot entered New Delhi. The demonstration turned ugly when police barricades were knocked down and New Delhi's 17th century Red Fort was stormed in a brief but shocking takeover. The protesters waved farm union and religious flags from the ramparts of the fort, where prime ministers annually hoist the national flag to mark the country's independence. The farmers say the vandals were largely from members of a Hindu nationalist group with close ties with PM Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), intent on sabotaging the peaceful movement. The government, in turn, accuses farmers of violating a deal that allowed their protests inside the Indian capital. The clashes left one protester dead and nearly 400 police officers wounded. Officials did not say how many farmers were wounded but many were seen bloodied after police in riot gear hit them with batons and fired tear gas. The issue has turned red hot with Riri, Ranaut and Greta What was simmering before the Red Fort incident has now erupted and the narrative now includes voices of international celebrities in support of farmers pitted against local stars . Police have arrested scores of people, continued search for farmer leaders with their passports, and also slapped sedition charges against several journalists over their reporting and online posts about a farmers' protest.

Twitter Inc's refusal to comply with an Indian government directive to block more than 250 accounts and posts has put the social media giant at the centre of a political firestorm in one of its key markets.

The showdown, after the firm this week \"declined to abide (by) and obey\" the order to remove posts and accounts that the government said risked inciting violence, is the latest instance of worsening relationships between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration and US social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp. For Twitter, the stakes are high in a country of 1.3 billion where it has millions of users and is ardently used by Modi, his cabinet ministers and other leaders to communicate with the public.

Japanese gaming giant Nintendo has reported bumper results, with unprecedented demand soaring as virus lockdowns boost the sector. While fresh waves of infections have dashed economic recovery hopes in many industries, tightened restrictions have helped extend a run of good fortune for gaming companies. Nintendo hiked its full-year forecast again on the strong results, including the runaway success of its Switch console and blockbuster pandemic hit game \"Animal Crossing\". The firm said on Monday global sales of the Switch for October-December rose to their highest level since the wildly popular console launched in March 2017. Net profit for April-December hit a record $3.6 billion ( 376.7 billion yen), up 91.8 percent from the same period a year earlier, while sales climbed 37.3 percent to $13.3 billion (1.4 trillion yen), it said.

The army of small investors behind this week's dramatic squeeze on Wall Street hedge funds have returned to drive shares in GameStop and other hot companies higher as online broker Robinhood eased disputed trading restrictions. GameStop shot up 75 percent, clawing back much of its steep loss from the day before, after slumping the day before when several online platforms imposed buying halts, sparking a backlash from investors, celebrities and policymakers. Robinhood buckled to pressure and said it will allow customers to start buying some of the stock again. The trading app said on its website that it was easing the restrictions, but still not allowing purchases of fractional shares in GameStop and 12 other companies, effectively meaning smaller investors have to bet more in order to buy in further to the trade. The website also showed the brokerage, which has said its hand has been forced by the surge in market volatility, was maintaining numerical limits on the number of shares any one account could hold in each of the companies, further hampering players with existing positions from betting on more gains. GameStop has been on a stupefying 1,600 percent run over the last three weeks and has become the battleground where swarms of smaller investors see themselves making an epic stand against the 1 percent. The assault is directed squarely at hedge funds and other Wall Street titans that had bet the struggling video game retailer\u2019s stock would fall.

Adidas said on Tuesday it had decided to begin a formal process aimed at divesting Reebok as part of a five-year strategy it plans to present on March 10, when the company will also publish 2020 results.

In the meantime, Adidas managed to eat into Nike's dominance in the United States with its core brand, helped by partnership with celebrities like Kanye West, Beyonce and Pharrell Williams. After Rorsted took over as CEO in 2016, he launched a turnaround plan for Reebok, which helped it return to profitability, but its performance continued to lag that of the core Adidas brand and it was then hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Reebok's net sales fell 7% in the third quarter of 2020 to $488 million, after falling as much as 44% the preceding quarter. In 2019, Adidas wrote down Reebok's book value by nearly half, compared with 2018, to 842 million euros. Options for Adidas include spinning Reebok off as a stand-alone public company, or selling the brand to private equity, another major sports retailer or a multibrand player like VF Corp.

Representatives underlined Washington\u2019s long standing role in enhancing innovative and bold ideas which makes it a home for many of the world\u2019s greatest innovators, artists, and entrepreneurs. However, growing wealth inequality and tax structure has been threatening Washington\u2019s social and economic status. \u201cAsking the state's poorest residents to pay six times more in taxes, as a share of their income, than the state's highest income households, including some of the wealthiest individuals in the world, is unconscionable,\u201d the representatives said in the bill. According to the tax system of the state, low income families pay nearly 18 percent income tax, while middle income families pay 11. Compare this to the highest income households who pay three percent or less income tax. The wealth tax bill would only cover a dozen people. Four of them, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, and Mackenzie Scott , would account for 97 percent of the tax\u2019s revenue.

The notice follows an announcement by the US Trade Representative's office that it would impose an additional 15 percent tariff on aircraft parts, including fuselage and wing assemblies, and a 25 percent duty on certain wines. Talks between Washington and Brussels to end the battle stalled in the final weeks of the Trump administration, a European source familiar with the matter said. Washington had also pressed to reach a separate solution with Britain, which has a share in Airbus, but has exited the EU. Brussels said it would seek swift resolution of the issue with US President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on January 20. The Biden team had no immediate comment on the tariff issue. Both Washington and Brussels have won cases at the World Trade Organization, the former allowed to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU goods and the latter extra duties on $4 billion of imports from the United States.

Encrypted messaging apps Signal and Telegram have seen huge upticks in downloads from Apple and Google\u2019s app stores. Facebook-owned WhatsApp, by contrast, has seen its growth decline following a fiasco that forced the company to clarify a privacy update it had sent to users. Mobile app analytics firm Sensor Tower said on Wednesday that Signal saw 17.8 million app downloads on Apple and Google during the week of January 5 to January 12. That\u2019s a 61-fold increase from just 285,000 the previous week. In the past 72 hours alone, Telegram, an already-popular messaging app for people around the world, recorded more than 25 million new users. WhatsApp, meanwhile, saw downloads shrink to 10.6 million, down from 12.7 million the week before.

Parler, meanwhile, was unceremoniously booted from the internet after Apple and Google banned it from their app stores for failing to moderate incitement. Amazon then cut Parler off from its cloud-hosting service. Experts worry that these moves could lead to more ideological splintering and further hide extremism in the dark corners of the internet, making it harder to track and counteract.

Disney has said its streaming services flourished while its parks, travel and film businesses remained hobbled by the pandemic at the end of last year. The entertainment colossus behind the Magic Kingdom and all its entertainment wonders saw subscriptions at its streaming services surge to more than 146 million subscribers, as people hunkering down due to the pandemic have turned to sources of online entertainment. The audience growth for Disney+, Hulu, ESPN and India's Hotstar comes as the parent company's travel and amusement park business suffered, and shows the entertainment giant is gaining ground on leading streaming service Netflix's 203 million subscribers. \"We're confident that, with our robust pipeline of exceptional, high-quality content and the upcoming launch of our new Star-branded international general entertainment offering, we are well-positioned to achieve even greater success going forward,\" Disney chief executive Bob Chapek said in an earnings release. Disney+ hits 95 mln subscribers The growth of Disney's streaming services, with the bulk of the audience made up of the 95 million subscribers who joined Disney+ since it launched about a year ago, trounced expectations. Disney+ alone added 21.2 million paid subscribers in the final quarter of last year, according to the earnings report. The entertainment giant is prioritising exclusive programming, original shows and movies, as well as bundled streaming services to build on the momentum of its various offerings, which extend beyond Disney+ to include ESPN, Hulu and Hotstar. Hit launches at Disney+ at the end of last year included an animated film \"Soul\" that combined comedy and drama with a message about finding the spark that gives life meaning. The quarter also featured a new season of original Star Wars spin-off series \"The Mandalorian.\" Disney has played to the strengths of its Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars teams, as well as its own studio content at the streaming service. \"Disney+ has been a massive success and is a testament to Disney's brand equity and"}

Nearly half of Switzerland's restaurants and hotels risk bankruptcy within months without financial support to weather devastating Covid-19 measures, the sector's employer group has warned. The Swiss government is expected this week to extend the closure of bars, restaurants, and leisure facilities across the country until the end of February to control stubbornly high coronavirus cases and death numbers. But industry federation GastroSuisse warned in a statement that if done without providing significant financial support, around half of businesses in the hospitality sector could go belly-up by the end of March.

Pakistan risks losing valuable real estate properties in the United States and France after a court was moved to enforce an international arbitration decision involving a cancelled mining concession. A court in the British Virgin Islands has appointed an official to assess the value of Roosevelt Hotel in New York and the Scribe in Paris - both owned by the state-run Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). A consortium of Barrick Gold and Antofagasta, the two multinational mining giants, wants control of the hotels as compensation against the cancellation of a copper and gold mining license. The companies say they were unjustly stopped from extracting the minerals. Islamabad on the other hand argues that the project was beset with irregularities and the country wasn\u2019t getting a good deal. Arbitration law experts from around the world have taken interest in the case since the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a World Bank quasi court, imposed a hefty $5.97 billion fine on Pakistan in 2019. Prime Minister Imran Khan\u2019s government is seeking an out-of-court settlement. But even then the cash-strapped South Asian economy can end up paying a substantial amount, says Nicolas Roux of Bilaterals.org, which keeps track of such cases. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say exactly how much Pakistan will pay because every case is different.

{"title": "JPMorgan: Bitcoin emergence as digital gold could lift price to $146,000", "content": "It could mark a new dawn for the volatile digital currency after years as a play for speculators and retail punters. Digital currency bitcoin has emerged as a rival to gold and could trade as high as $146,000 if it becomes established as a safe-haven asset, investment bank JPMorgan (JPM) said on Tuesday. Interest in the world's biggest cryptocurrency has soared this year, with investors viewing bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to the depreciating dollar. The rush led to bitcoin prices more than tripling in the past six months to a record peak of $34,800 on January 2. \"Bitcoin's competition with gold has already started in our mind,\" the Wall Street bank's strategists said in a note, citing recent $7 billion outflows from gold and more than $3 billion of inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. That could mark a new dawn for the volatile digital currency after years as a play for speculators and retail punters. \"Considering how big the financial investment into gold is, a crowding out of gold as an 'alternative' currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term,\" JPM said. Bitcoin is likely to outshine gold as millennials become a more important component of the investment market over time and given their preference for \"digital gold\" over traditional bullion, JPM added. With a market capitalisation of $575 billion, the bitcoin price would need a nearly fivefold jump to $146,000 to match the value of private gold wealth held in gold bars, coins or exchange-traded funds, the bank's note added. JPM strategists said the upside is conditional on the volatility of bitcoin converging with that of gold in the longer term. Though JPM sees the possibility of \"current speculative mania\" propelling bitcoin to between $50,000 and $100,000, it warned that such levels would prove unsustainable until its volatility levels out. \"We note that the spectacular bitcoin rally of the past few weeks has moved bitcoin into more challenging territory, not only in terms of its positioning backdrop, but also in terms of its valuation,\" the bank said."}

The January 11-14 event will go on without the glitzy spectacles and showy product unveilings which have in past years drawn tens of thousands of industry participants. \"We've been forced to adapt and we have,\" said Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Technology Association, which produces the show, adding that the new format \"will illustrate how innovation paves the way for a brighter tomorrow.\" The digital show may allow exhibitors, buyers and others to make better use of their time by connecting with the most relevant people, said Jean Foster, a senior vice president of the trade association. \"So we really built around the concept of people being able to interact with each other,\" she told AFP. Generating buzz Some unveilings which would normally draw crowds in Las Vegas are going ahead in the virtual space: Audi is set to launch its electric sports car, and LG will show off a large bendable display for gamers; other companies will be releasing gadgets adapted to superfast 5G wireless networks which are gaining traction. But some analysts say the lack of in-person events has pushed many participants to the sidelines. \"You're not going to find cool things by stumbling on them,\" said Bob O'Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research.

Elon Musk, the outspoken and envelope-pushing chief executive of Tesla, has overtaken Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to become the world's wealthiest person, US media reported. Musk is a major shareholder of the electric car company and has benefited from Tesla's surging share price over the last year. CNBC estimated Musk's wealth at $185 billion. Musk's wealth surge over the past year marks the fastest rise to the top of the rich list in history and marks a dramatic financial turnaround for the famed entrepreneur who just 18 months ago was in the headlines for Tesla's rapid cash burn and his personal leverage against Tesla's stock. Musk started 2020 worth about $27 billion and was barely in the top 50 richest people.

But the new plan allows oil development on about 80 percent of the reserve. US President Donald Trump's administration has announced that it has finalised its plan to open up vast areas of once-protected Arctic Alaska territory to oil development. The announcement was made on Monday. The decision, which will open up more land in the western North Slope, is one of a number of pro-drilling actions taken by the Trump administration in its final days. It comes just before a scheduled auction of drilling rights in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) on the eastern North Slope on Wednesday. The US Bureau of Land Management released its plan for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A), a 9.3 million-hectare swath of land on the western North Slope. The plan, signed by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt on December 21, allows lease sales to proceed under relaxed standards. The NPR-A is Alaska's primary locale for the state's daily oil production, which averaged 466,000 barrels per day in 2019, according to US Energy Department data.

Small drones will be allowed to fly over people and at night in the United States in a significant step toward their use for widespread commercial deliveries. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday that its long-awaited rules for the drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, will address security concerns by requiring remote identification technology in most cases to enable their identification from the ground.

From January 1, British-based financial services groups lose automatic access to the EU's single market, and both sides have said new market access must be negotiated outside the trade agreement in specific equivalence deals. \"Now that we've left the European Union, we can do things a bit differently (in financial services),\" Sunak told broadcasters. Britain and the EU clinched a trade deal on Thursday, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has admitted it is an accord which does not have as much as he would have liked about the financial services sector and regulatory equivalence.

The two sides will aim to agree a memorandum of understanding on regulatory cooperation in financial services by March 2021, and Sunak said that such language should provide reassurance. \"This deal also provides reassurance because there's a stable regulatory co-operative framework mentioned in the deal,\" he said. \"I think (that) will give people that reassurance that we will remain in close dialogue with our European partners when it comes to things like equivalence decisions.\" READ MORE: UK and EU agreed to a post-Brexit trade deal.

Russia could gain powers to restrict access to US social media giants if they \"discriminate\" against Russian media and levy big fines on platforms that do not delete banned content, under bills passed by the parliament's lower house on Wednesday. The authors of the two bills said infractions by YouTube and Facebook demonstrated the need for the legislation, which is part of a push to increase Russia's internet \"sovereignty\" and has fuelled fears of creeping China-style controls, which is also prevalent in the US. The first bill would allow Russia to restrict or fully block websites following what lawmakers said were complaints from state outlets that their accounts were being treated with prejudice by Twitter, Facebook and Youtube. Twitter began labelling the accounts of several Russian media outlets with the description \"state-affiliated media\", along with those of their senior staff and some key government officials in August, a move decried by Russia at the time. The second bill would allow Russia to fine internet providers and sites between 10% and 20% of their previous year's Russia-based turnover for repeatedly failing to remove banned content. The bill sets a maximum fine of 8 million roubles ($106,130) for the first time sites fail to delete content calling for extremist activity, information about recreational drugs and child sexual abuse.

But there's a downside to living in a technologically advanced world too \u2014 and that comes in the form of discouraging people from having more or any children at all. While people have grown accustomed to the comforts and ease that comes with technology, they also have to deal with the ever increasing size of their utility bills. And that dynamic influences their thinking, makes the prospect of having and raising children a costly commitment. As a result, many countries in the world suffer from significant population decreases despite the fact that they promote sustainable development programs, pursuing endless economic growth. The main flaw in such policies is that implementing and sustaining developmental programs becomes a near-impossible task if governments are struggling from low populations. They simply can't run their countries efficiently. On top of decreasing population rates across the world, the global pandemic with its terrible human cost has made things worse, leading to more declines in population levels.

The buzzing newsroom has long been the lifeblood of American newspapers. But in recent months the buzz has become virtual as the pandemic deepens the industry crisis and forces journalists to work remotely. In recent months, established dailies such as the New York Daily News, Miami Herald and Baltimore Sun have joined other news outlets abandoning their headquarters, amid pandemic workplace restrictions that had already left them empty. Tribune Publishing, owner of the Baltimore daily and others, has acknowledged it is re-evaluating its real estate needs as it struggles with a difficult environment, with lower print circulation, falling advertising revenues and increased costs for health and safety. But many journalists say the loss of the newsroom has changed the nature of their work and worry that newspapers may not re-establish newsrooms even after the pandemic. \"A newsroom is a lot more collaborative than a lot of other workspaces are,\" said Emily Brindley, a reporter at the Tribune-owned Hartford (Connecticut) Courant, which shut its newsroom this month. \"I definitely think that it's going to have an effect on the product,\" added Brindley, an organizer of the Courant Guild, which represents journalists. \"I do feel that there will be some intangible effects.\" One of Brindley's colleagues in Hartford, Daniela Altimari, said she believes the pandemic \"proved that we could all work from home and still put out a newspaper,\" making it unlikely the newsroom will reopen. She fears for the quality of the work. \"Newsrooms are factories for ideas in a way. There's a lot of chance encounters,\" Altimari said. \"You get ideas by talking to colleagues.

The complex case, brought after Mastercard lost an appeal against a 2007 European Commission ruling that its fees were anti-competitive, could entitle adults in Britain to almost $400 each if it is successful. The court dismissed a Mastercard appeal, setting the scene for Britain's first mass consumer claim brought under a new legal regime and establishing a standard for a string of other, stalled class actions. \"Mastercard has been ... imposing excessive card transaction charges over a prolonged period in a way it must have known would impose an invisible tax on UK consumers,\" said Walter Merricks, a lawyer who is leading the action.

As required by recent legislation, the fine was applied to platforms that are accessed over 1 million times per day in Turkey, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Periscope, Linkedin, Dailymotion and TikTok, sources told Anadolu Agency on Friday. A new social media law came into effect on October 1, 2020. After the first 30-day period to appoint their local representatives, authorities had fined social media platforms around $1.2 million. Meanwhile, Russian site VK has since appointed a representative and escaped the penalty. After the second 30-day term, the penalty rose to $3.8 million.

African countries have begun officially trading under a new continent-wide free trade area, after months of delays caused by the global coronavirus pandemic. But experts view the New Year's Day launch as largely symbolic with full implementation of the deal expected to take years. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) aims to bring together 1.3 billion people in a $3.4 trillion economic bloc that will be the largest free trade area since the establishment of the World Trade Organization. Backers say it will boost trade among African neighbours while allowing the continent to develop its own value chains. If fully implemented, the AfCFTA will lift 30 million Africans out of extreme poverty and 70 million from moderate poverty, according to World Bank estimates. But obstacles - ranging from ubiquitous red tape and poor infrastructure to the entrenched protectionism of some of its members - must be overcome if the bloc is to reach its full potential. Trade under the AfCFTA was meant to be launched on July 1 but was pushed back after Covid-19 made in-person negotiations impossible. However, the pandemic also gave the process added impetus, said Silver Ojakol, chief of staff at the AfCFTA's secretariat. \"We saw the impact on our economies of the disruption of imports due to the pandemic,\" he said. \"So there's actually been an increase in political will to boost intra-African integration.\" Internal trade within the continent currently stands at a meagre 16 percent, while 65 percent of their commerce is with European countries READ MORE: Can Africa\u2019s free trade agreement transform the continent?

The agency highlighted that the Turkish central bank, under its new leadership, has simplified monetary policy to improve transparency and predictability, strengthened its communication strategy and increased its tightening by raising interest rates by 675 basis points during the months of November and December. \"Authorities have also reversed previous regulatory measures to rein in rapid credit growth,\" it said, adding international reserves have also stabilised and recovered slightly.

Turkey's current account deficit is expected to fall to 2.9 percent in 2021 and 2.1 percent of GDP in 2022, from 5.3 percent in 2020, due to slower domestic demand and reduced gold imports, according to Fitch.

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the value of a single unit of Bitcoin has skyrocketed from below $10,000 to over $53,000, as eager investors around the world rush to join in on the cryptocurrency market frenzy. Part of the attraction in adopting Bitcoin as a digital asset is due to it being a finite currency and a hedge against inflation. To be useful as a currency, an important question needs to be answered: can people use Bitcoin to shop for everyday items? The answer is yes. Several companies have introduced new and improved payment methods to sell products using the cryptocurrency. In 2014, American internet retailer Overstock became one of the first big online sellers to accept direct Bitcoin payments. A few years later, others started to follow suit. PayPal joined the cryptocurrency market last October, allowing customers to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and other virtual coins using the US digital payments company\u2019s online wallets. Tesla, which made headlines by investing $1.5 billion in Bitcoin earlier this month, announced it will begin accepting it as a form of payment for its products in the near future. However, the company also underlined that these cryptocurrency transactions will be \u201csubject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis.\u201d Even though many businesses don't accept direct Bitcoin payments, there are other ways to spend it. A useful tracker is BitcoinWide . It lists companies that accept Bitcoin and regularly updates its database. Many retail investors buy Bitcoin now through companies like Coinbase and BitPay. They operate as exchanges, processing trades between buyers and sellers. Here are a few areas in which people can purchase goods or services via Bitcoin. Online gift cards Although retail giants like Amazon and BestBuy don't accept it yet, people can purchase goods by using third-party services.

{"title": "Why are gold prices falling?", "content": "After a rapid rise in 2020, the price of gold has plunged in recent months due to a weakening demand by central banks, a lacklustre jewellery market and weak investor interest. Since countries started their mass vaccination campaigns against the coronavirus, the price of gold has plummeted. Record low levels were reached last August at $2,070 per ounce, when economic and social uncertainty wreaked havoc around the world due to the pandemic. According to the Bank of America (BofA), there are three main reasons for the decreasing value of gold: the weakening of physical demand, a lacklustre jewellery market, and a lack of investor interest. However, the bank forecast prices could still reach an average of $2,063 an ounce this year. By February 19, it was around $ 1,770 per ounce, about a six percent drop since the start of this year. In 2020, the price of gold steadily climbed nearly 22 percent as many countries tried to stem economic bleeding from pandemic lockdowns through stimulus packages and bailouts for businesses. Bank of America analysts suggest three key headwinds facing the gold market should be monitored: Weakening physical demand While central banks\u2019 purchase of gold otherwise traditionally pushed market prices up, BofA underlined that there have been signs of fading demand. First is the pandemic, which caused a fall in world central banks\u2019 demand for gold. It decreased by nearly 60 percent in 2020, according to the World Gold Council(WGC). In the fourth quarter of 2020 alone, central banks bought a net of 44.8 tonnes of gold, while it was about 140.7 tonnes a year before that. Gold\u2019s underperformance over the year led to an increase in reserve portfolios, which led some central banks to spot \u201can opportune time to obtain liquidity to support their struggling economies,\u201d during the pandemic. For example, seven central banks around the world decreased their gold reserves over the course of 2020, according to the World Gold Council.

But a new report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggests that global economic recovery is on the horizon, albeit in slow motion. \u201cGlobal economic prospects have improved markedly in recent months, helped by the gradual deployment of effective vaccines, announcements of additional fiscal support in some countries, and signs that economies are coping better with measures to suppress the virus,\u201d the report noted. Vaccine distribution and management of new Covid-19 variants will be crucial in determining which direction the world will be heading to in the near future, the report says. According to the report, the global 2021 GDP growth will be 5.6 percent, while it will decline to 4 percent in 2022. The global output is expected to reach its pre-pandemic level in the middle of this year. But even at the end of 2022, national output and incomes are likely to continue to stay below the level predicted ahead of the pandemic. But some economists are sceptical about the report. \u201cI think that while both global and national GDP levels are good indicators to measure performances of the world economy and country finances, they do not show how much the levels of social welfare have been improved,\u201d says Gokhan Ovenc, a lecturer of the economics department at the Istanbul University. It means that while the global economy is expected to emerge from the gloom, national economies, particularly income and employment levels, might continue to suffer significantly. As long as Covid-19 continues to rage across the world, a healthy global recovery may not be easy to attain. This is because trade and investment, two important components of any recovery effort, will still be regarded as risky ventures, according to Ovenc.

The current CO2 standards need a \"significant strengthening\", and the EU must also bolster charging and refuelling infrastructure for zero-emission vehicles, the countries said. EU legislation should also be amended to allow countries to take national action to phase out new petrol and diesel cars, they said. Many carmakers have already laid out a timetable to switch to all-electric car line-ups. Within the last month, Swedish carmaker Volvo said it would become fully electric by 2030, and Ford Motor Co said all its cars sold in Europe would be electric by the same date.

Walt Disney Co's Disney+ streaming service has surpassed more than 100 million paying subscribers around the world, Chief Executive Bob Chapek said at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. The platform's growth has trounced expectations, and has come at a time when Disney's parks, travel and film businesses are hobbled by the pandemic. \"Our direct-to-consumer business is the Company's top priority, and our robust pipeline of content will continue to fuel its growth,\" said Chapek. Chapek also said Disney hopes to reopen its California theme parks to limited attendance in late April. The parks were closed a year ago due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The world's second-most visited theme park has been closed for almost exactly a year, with the mega attraction near Los Angeles unable to reopen last summer even while other Disney resorts did so worldwide. \"Here in California, we're encouraged by the positive trends we're seeing and we're hopeful they'll continue to improve and we'll be able to reopen our Parks to guests with limited capacity by late April,\" said Chapek. A precise opening date would be confirmed \"in the coming weeks,\" he added. The statement during Disney's annual shareholders meeting follows state officials' announcement last week that reopening criteria for theme parks and outdoor stadiums will be relaxed from April 1, as a winter spike in coronavirus cases rapidly recedes. Theme parks will only be allowed to reopen if their county drops below the state's most-restrictive coronavirus \"tier,\" and then initially at 15 percent capacity and for California residents only. Chapek cautioned that Disneyland could not reopen on the first day of next month as it would take time to recall more than 10,000 furloughed staff members, and to retrain them in pandemic safety measures. Disney, along with other operators and local officials, has ramped up pressure on state officials to allow swifter reopenings, after previous guidance meant theme parks would be among the last places to reopen in California.

India's economy has contracted 7.5 percent between July and September, putting it among the worst-performing major advanced and emerging economies, as it entered a technical recession for the first time since independence, official data has shown. Although the figures released on Friday were an improvement on the record 23.9 percent contraction recorded last quarter, they indicate that Asia's third-largest economy is in for a tough fight as it attempts to revive demand and create jobs even as coronavirus infections climb. The two successive quarters of contraction mean that the country has now entered a \"technical recession\" for the first time since 1947. After virus-led lockdowns ravaged the globe, the growth recorded by major economies including the United States, Japan, and Germany during the quarter ending on September 30 raised expectations that India would also enjoy a revival. But, while consumer businesses saw a boost due to increased spending in the run-up to the October-November festive season, hopes of a broader recovery were dashed, with the construction and hospitality sectors taking a hit.

That may test Walsh's aversion to bailouts and subsidies. Little was said about further aid at the meeting, which ended on Wednesday, though de Juniac called days earlier for $80 billion in support on top of the $160 billion received. Despite vaccines promising eventual relief, executives worry they might reduce the immediate pressure on policymakers to reopen travel safely.

There's little doubt that government-ordered business shutdowns to stop the spread of Covid-19 damaged the US economy, but the exact cost has not been clear. Researchers from HEC Paris business school and Bocconi University in Milan have reached a sobering calculation: the closures beginning at the pandemic's onset in March through May saved 29,000 lives, at a cost of $169 billion, or around $6 million per person. \"Governors saved lives on the one hand, but reduced economic activity on the other,\" said Jean-Noel Barrot, a professor at HEC Paris and member of France's National Assembly. How to address the world's largest coronavirus outbreak has become a vexing, politically charged question in the United States, where the virus has infected more than 12.2 million people and killed nearly 257,000. Virus cases are surging nationwide, prompting many states to again implement restrictions on businesses.

The bank was previously indicted on charges of helping Iran evade US sanctions.

Total losses from natural and man-made disasters so far this year are estimated at $187 billion (154 billion euros), up 25 percent from 2019, the reinsurance giant Swiss Re has said. That marks a hike from 2019 when natural disasters caused losses of $139 billion but remains below the 10-year average of $202 billion. Insurers covered less than half of the total losses, dishing out $83 billion, making 2020 the fifth-costliest year for the industry since 1970, Swiss Re said in a statement on Tuesday. Disasters in the United States \u2014 severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods and wildfires accounted for a full 70 percent of the $76 billion, which went to cover losses in natural catastrophes.

Uber rival Ola plans to build the world's largest scooter factory in India, aiming to make two million electric two-wheelers a year for Asia, Europe and Latin America. The Indian ride-hailing firm, which has financial backing from Japan's SoftBank, said it will create 10,000 jobs and invest $325 million in the plant in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The factory will help make India a \"manufacturing hub for electric vehicles\" as Ola gears up to launch its e-scooters in the coming months, the company said on Monday. Motorbikes and mopeds, which are much cheaper than four-wheelers, are hugely popular in India's congested cities, with sales outselling those of cars many times over. But they also add to air pollution and Ola hopes to profit from government efforts to promote electric vehicles by expanding from ride-hailing to making scooters itself. With plans for two million electric scooters in a year, Ola can potentially replace Honda's Gujarat set up which currently makes 1.2 million petrol scooters annually. This year Ola announced plans to hire over 2,000 people for its electric business, bringing in General Motors veteran Jose Pinheiro to head its manufacturing operations. In May the firm, which is active in India, Australia, New Zealand and Britain, acquired Dutch electric scooter maker Etergo, reportedly for $250 million.

Bitcoin\u2019s blistering rally has seen a massive flow of coin to North America from East Asia, fuelled by hunger for bitcoin among bigger and compliance-wary US investors. The rally in bitcoin, which some investors have seen as a potential safe-haven, has coincided with spot gold\u2019s drop in recent months.

The rules announced on Tuesday are the most serious attempt by the 27-country bloc to tame tech companies that control troves of data and online platforms relied on by thousands of companies and millions of Europeans for their work and social interactions. They also mark the European Commission's frustration with its antitrust cases against the tech giants, notably Alphabet's Google, which critics say did not address the problem.

Tony Georgiou sighed as he stood in front of a field full of parked taxi cabs, admitting he has lost count of how many are there. Many London taxi drivers rent their instantly-recognisable black cabs from fleet companies such as GB Taxi Services, where Georgiou is one of the owners. But with London's streets emptied by the coronavirus lockdown, many drivers are unable to keep paying for their vehicles and are handing them back in droves. \"There's probably around 150 to 200 vehicles that are here, which we've had to take off the road,\" said Georgiou, whose company has parked its vehicles in Epping northeast of the capital. \"I've lost count\". Famed worldwide, the British capital's bulbous black cabs were originally designed to accommodate a passenger in a top hat. To earn a license, drivers have to pass a fiendishly difficult exam called \"The Knowledge\", which tests their recall of streets, routes and landmarks purely from memory. But fields full of taxis are now a mass phenomenon, said Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association (LTDA). \"It's happening all over, all round the M25 there are fields with cabs like that,\" said McNamara, referring to the main orbital motorway around London.

Alphabet Inc's Google has faced its third major lawsuit as a group of 38 US states and territories filed an antitrust complaint accusing Google of seeking to extend its search monopoly to dominate smart speakers, televisions, and cars. The states are asking for their lawsuit to be consolidated with one filed by the Justice Department in October, according to a statement from the Colorado attorney general's office. The complaint focuses on Google's search business and search advertising, as well as what they said was an effort by Google to use exclusionary agreements to also dominate newer technologies. This would exclude, for example, competing virtual assistant technology such as Amazon.com Inc's Alexa. READ MORE: Texas files a suit against Google over alleged anti-competitive practices 'Google prevents competitors' The accusation builds on concerns publicly expressed by speaker maker Sonos and other companies that say Google has acted unfairly to grow its market power. \"Google is preventing competitors in the voice assistant market from reaching consumers through connected cars, which stand to be a significant way the internet is accessed in the near future,\" said Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google shares were down 0.8 percent on Thursday afternoon. The federal government's complaint was joined by 11 states and accused the $1 trillion giant of acting unlawfully to maintain its position in search and advertising on the internet. On Wednesday, a group of Republican attorneys general led by Texas filed a separate lawsuit focused on Google's dominance of digital advertising. These lawsuits, in addition to two filed against social media giant Facebook Inc this month, promise to be the biggest antitrust cases in a generation, as big as the lawsuit against Microsoft filed in 1998.

The Federal Aviation Administration said the approval followed \"an unprecedented level of collaborative and independent reviews by aviation authorities around the world.\" In a video that accompanied the announcement, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said he was \"100 percent comfortable\" with having his family fly the jet. Dickson piloted test flights during the approval process. The plane was grounded after two crashes that killed a total of 346 people in 2018 and 2019. Both Boeing and the FAA have come under fire in the wake of the crisis, with critics saying Boeing sacrificed safety for profit and that FAA was too deferential to the private giant. A principal cause of the two crashes was identified as a faulty flight handling system that was supposed to keep the plane from stalling as it ascended but instead forced the nose of the plane downward. Victims' families blast decision Boeing applauded the FAA's action as an \"important milestone\" in the company's journey to restoring its reputation and safely returning the jet to service. \"We will never forget the lives lost in the two tragic accidents that led to the decision to suspend operations,\" said Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun.

The country appeared to make a sharp bounceback from its biggest postwar slump in the third quarter, thanks to the financial stimulus it recently announced, breathing life into its sluggish economy and making major gains, especially in the internal tourism sector, export economy and domestic retail consumption. The world\u2019s third-largest economy expanded an annualised 21.4 percent in July-September. Government data showed on Monday that this went beyond the market forecast, marking the first increase in four quarters.

Indian expat Saad Khan said he realised there was \"huge opportunity\" in promoting eSports in the region four years ago, when he saw people crowding into rapidly sprouting cyber cafes in Dubai, one of the UAE's seven emirates. That's when Khan, who has a strong background in technology, decided to found Gamers Hub Media Events (GHME) to host e-Sports tournaments in the Middle East and North Africa. \"We're here for the gamers, we are here for our sponsors, and we are here to give the best experience possible,\" said 45-year-old Khan, who is CEO of the company. In an effort to diversify its oil-dependent economy and boost its soft power, the United Arab Emirates and its legion of young expats have in recent years jumped into a range of sectors, including sports and technology. The global games and interactive media industry grew 12 percent to $139.9 billion last year, according to US-based data analytics company Nielsen.

Technology companies\u2019 services could be banned from the European market if they do not heed EU regulation, Europe\u2019s industry chief Thierry Breton told German weekly Welt am Sonntag, as the European Commission finalises rules on internet companies. Breton will announce new draft rules known as the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act together with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager on Dec. 2. The rules will set out a list of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for gatekeepers - online companies with market power - forcing them to share data with rivals and regulators and not to promote their services and products unfairly. The new draft rules come as critics of US tech giants, which include companies and industry bodies, question the EU\u2019s rulings against Alphabet unit Google, saying they have not curbed its allegedly anti-competitive behaviour. Some want EU enforcers to go further than just ordering companies to stop such practices. The draft rules would allow the EU to ban companies or part of their services from the 27-country bloc as an extreme option. Until the draft rules are adopted EU antitrust and digital regulators do not currently have the power to impose such bans. \u201cStrict rules must be enforceable\u201d, Breton told Welt am Sonntag. \u201cFor this we need the appropriate arsenal of possible measures: Impose fines, exclude companies or parts of their services from the Single Market, insist that they split up if they want to keep access to the Single Market.

China's ByteDance has told an Indian court that a government freeze on its bank accounts in a probe of possible tax evasion amounts to harassment and was done illegally, according to a court filing seen by Reuters. ByteDance in January reduced its Indian workforce after New Delhi maintained a ban on its popular video app TikTok, imposed last year after a border clash between India and China. Beijing has repeatedly criticised India over that ban and those of other Chinese apps. An Indian tax intelligence unit in mid-March ordered HSBC and Citibank in Mumbai to freeze bank accounts of ByteDance India as it probed some of the unit's financial dealings. ByteDance has challenged the freeze on the four accounts in a Mumbai court. None of ByteDance India's employees have been paid their March salaries due to the account freeze, said two people familiar with the matter. The company told the court it has a workforce of 1,335, including outsourced personnel. 'Drastic action', 'undue coercion' In the 209-page court filing lodged on March 25, ByteDance told the High Court in Mumbai the authorities acted against the company without any material evidence and gave no prior notice, as required by Indian law, before such \"drastic action\". Blocking accounts \"during the process of investigation amounts (to) applying undue coercion,\" ByteDance argued. It is \"intended, improperly, to harass the petitioner.\" India's Directorate General of Goods & Services Tax Intelligence, and the finance ministry which oversees it, did not immediately respond to requests for comment over the weekend. The details of the tax investigation have not previously been reported.

Does that make them company employees? Uber is driving right into a legal roadblock over its alleged use of computer algorithms to decide the fate of its drivers. On Monday, the UK-based App Drivers and Couriers Union (ADCU) filed a lawsuit in the Netherlands, where the ride-hailing giant's headquarters is located along with its massive database. Four drivers from the United Kingdom and Portugal say they were blocked out of the app without the company telling them what exactly they had done wrong. The lawsuit is the first of its kind that has been filed under the General Data Protection Regulation\u2019s (GDPR) Article 22. GDPR, introduced by the European Union in 2018, protects user data and allows European citizens to demand information if they feel an automated decision was made about them. \u201cIn each of the cases the drivers were dismissed after Uber said its systems had detected fraudulent activity on the part of the individuals concerned.

The fight turned nasty after taxi drivers began hunting down Uber drivers to beat them up. The California-based tech firm, which promised to revolutionise the gig economy, is under scrutiny in different parts of the world over predatory pricing allegations, non-competitive practices and the way it treats its drivers. One of the points of contention between Istanbul taxi drivers and Uber, was the XL service: Uber contractors who ferried customers in cozy leather-seated Mercedes and Volkswagen vans which at times offered passengers free drinks and sweets. That service was popular not just among the 50 million-plus tourists who came to Turkey in the pre-pandemic era, it was also becoming a preferable mode of transportation for locals. The court decision on Uber says it can work with the cabbies as the ride-hailing service hasn\u2019t indicated if it intends to introduce its XL service as well.

Europe needs to pump $355 billion (300 billion euros) into its telecoms infrastructure by 2025 if it wants to roll out super fast 5G across the 27-country bloc to boost economic growth and tap the potential of the technology, a report has said. The study by consulting firm BCG, commissioned by telecoms lobbying group ETNO, comes as the European Union pins its hopes on 5G to lift it out of a Covid-19 pandemic-induced recession and take the lead in internet-connected devices. But EU telecoms operators have been reluctant to invest in 5G networks, which could support smart factories and self-driving cars, because of the massive outlay, while they say plans to scale up via mergers to take on these costly projects have been stymied by tough EU antitrust rules. \"150 billion euros is still needed to achieve a full-5G scenario in Europe, while an additional 150 billion euros is required to finish upgrading fixed infrastructure to gigabit speeds,\" the report said. Delays in auctioning of 5G spectrum \u2013 airwaves necessary for operators to start offering commercial 5G \u2013 due to governments shifting focus to counter the pandemic have also disappointed the industry.

Loosening rules to allow telecoms providers to cooperate and co-invest or to split infrastructure construction from telecommunications services businesses were also some of the suggestions. The study also called for operators to be allowed to monetise data traffic on their networks to catch up with rivals such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and other tech giants.

The 400-metre, 224,000-tonne Ever Given was stranded on Tuesday morning after losing the ability to steer amid high winds and a dust storm, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said in a statement. About 30 percent of global container ship traffic passes through the canal each day, carrying everything from fuel to consumer goods.

The coronavirus pandemic has left economies all over the world in tatters, but the downfall didn't affect the richest of the rich. Although the pandemic triggered large-scale unemployment in the world, the billionaire class continued to harness the economic dividends from the shaky markets. Roughly three out of four American billionaires have increased their net capital since the outbreak of the pandemic in March this year. At least 16 American billionaires doubled their net fortunes since the beginning of the pandemic that spread around the world in March. Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of the multinational technology company Amazon, is expected to become $73 billion richer - he was already reputedly worth $113 billion at the beginning of the year. During the pandemic, Mark Zuckerberg, chairman of Facebook, added another $46 billion to his $54 billion wealth. The net capital of SpaceX and Tesla\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, rocketed from $25 billion to $92 billion despite the gloomy international backdrop. Jeff Bezos appears to have made windwall profits as Amazon posted huge gains as the virus drove people online for both shopping and food-delivery services.

Apple has unveiled four new iPhones equipped with technology for use with faster new 5G wireless networks, hoping that demand for higher data speeds will spark demand for new phones. That might not happen as quickly as Apple would like. In a virtual presentation on Tuesday, the company announced four 5G-enabled versions of the new iPhone 12 ranging in price from almost $700 to roughly $1,100. Apple also announced a new, less expensive version of its HomePod smart speaker. Smartphone sales have been slowing for years as their technology has matured. That has meant far fewer gotta-have-it innovations that can drive demand and, at least until recently, increasingly pricey phones. Add to that pandemic-related economic crisis, and consumers have tended to eke as much life as possible out of their existing phones. Apple, however, is clearly betting that 5G speeds could push many users off the fence. At its event, the company boasted about 5G capabilities and brought in Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg to champion the carrier's network. 5G is supposed to mean much faster speeds, making it quicker to download movies or games, for instance. But finding those speeds can be a challenge. While telecom operators have been rolling out 5G networks, significant boosts in speed are still uncommon in much of the world, including the US.

The first message ever fired off at Twitter has sold for $2.9 million when its sender Jack Dorsey accepted the winning bid for the collectible as a \"non fungible token\" or NFT at an auction. \"Jack accepted the offer from sinaEstavi for $2,915,835.47,\" read a tweet from the Valuables by Cent auction platform. \"This tweet is now minted on the blockchain.\" The profile on the auction-winning account indicated it belonged to Sina Estavi, chief executive of blockchain technology-related startup Bridge Oracle. A copy of Dorsey's inaugural tweet and a history of the bidding was posted at the v.cent.co website. Dorsey's tweet highlighted a surge of interest around NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. NFTs use the same blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies to turn anything from art to sports trading cards into virtual collector's items that cannot be duplicated. Fifteen years ago Dorsey typed out a banal message - \"just setting up my twttr\" - which became the first ever tweet, launching a global platform that has become a controversial and dominant force in civil society. The short tweet was sent March 21, 2006 by the Twitter co-founder and chief, who said he would donate the money from its sale to charity. \"I think years later people will realize the true value of this tweet, like the Mona Lisa painting,\" Estavi said in a Twitter post.

Greek Cypriot administration has scrapped a lucrative programme granting citizenship to wealthy investors amid new allegations that a top state official and a veteran lawmaker were implicated in attempts to bypass strict vetting rules and issue a passport to a fictitious investor with a supposed criminal record. Greek Administration of Southern Cyprus said it was suspending a controversial citizenship for investment programme on Tuesday following reports of abuses of a system that gives the rich a passport and visa-free travel throughout the EU. Criticism of the programme reached a head after the Al Jazeera network secretly filmed a state official, a lawmaker and a lawyer apparently attempting to help an imaginary Chinese investor, with a criminal record, get a passport. A criminal record should disqualify a candidate. Several news outlets, including Reuters, have carried reports in the past two years on a scheme where thousands of foreign investors with deep pockets have leapfrogged over normally arduous citizenship processes, including for persons born on the island. Parliament speaker to abstain from duties Parliamentary speaker Demetris Syllouris, seen in the video apparently offering to use his influence in getting the investor a passport, and suggesting alternatives if that failed, said he would be standing down from his duties from October 19. Syllouris, 67, is the second-highest-ranking official in Greek Cypriot administration after Greek Cypriot leader Nicos Anastasiades. He said he would withdraw until an investigation was complete. \"I would like to publicly apologise for this unpleasant image conveyed to the Cypriot public ... And any upset it may have caused,\" he said in a statement. Syllouris has previously said he suspected something was amiss with the imaginary investor but was fishing for information.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged development banks to stop backing fossil fuel projects, after a report found the World Bank had invested $12 billion in the sector since the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change. Environmental campaigners have for years tried to prevent the oil, coal and natural gas industry from producing dangerous levels of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change by persuading commercial banks to stop lending them money. But the world's state-backed development banks, whose support is often crucial in determining whether projects in developing countries go ahead, are also facing growing calls to starve the industry of finance. Guterres urged a coalition of finance ministers and economic policymakers from dozens of countries to ensure development banks end fossil fuel investments and boost renewable energy. \"We need speed, scale, and decisive leadership,\" Guterres said in a video message to a virtual meeting of the group. Earlier on Monday, a report by Berlin-based environmental group Urgewald said that the World Bank had invested more than $12 billion in fossil fuels since the Paris accord, $10.5 billion of which was direct finance for new projects. That put the World Bank far ahead of other development banks in supporting the sector, said Heike Mainhardt, a senior adviser to Urgewald, who wrote the report .

The reform is part of the government's Digital Spain 2025 strategy, one of whose aims is to improve the country's appeal as one of the most attractive locations for shooting films and series. The text \"extends the obligation to fund European audiovisual production to those providers offering services in Spain even if they're not based there\" in a nod to platforms like Netflix, HBO, Disney and Amazon Prime Video. READ MORE: US and France in showdown over digital tax \"Providers with a turnover of more than 50 million euros generated from services in Spain must allocate 5.0 per cent of these revenues to finance European audiovisual works or as a contribution to the Cinematography Protection Fund,\" it says. Of that amount, 70 per cent must be used to finance audiovisual works by independent producers, and a minimum of 40 per cent must be used to fund independent films \"in any of Spain's official languages\". For those earning under 50 million euros, that 5.0 per cent can be diverted into buying the rights to finished European productions, but at least 70 per cent must go towards works by independent producers. Those earning under 10 million euros in Spain will be exempt from the proposed tax.

Nigeria's Foreign Ministry has said it will lobby for its candidate to head the World Trade Organization, in reaction to her last-minute rejection by Washington that threw the regulator's leadership selection process into confusion. The United States on Wednesday spurned Nigerian former Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala hours after a high-powered WTO panel recommended her to lead the global trade watchdog, teeing her up to become its first African and first woman head. \"Nigeria will continue to engage relevant stakeholders to ensure that the lofty aspiration of her candidate to lead the World Trade Organization is realised,\" the country's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday evening. However, a person involved in the leadership race cast doubt on Nigeria's plans to bring pressure to bear on Washington. \"They can push in the sense that they can get on the phone, try to mobilise support, but is that going to change the view in Washington? I think not,\" the person, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters.

The US Trade Representative's office later released a statement officially backing the only other remaining candidate, South Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee, praising her as a successful trade negotiator with the skills needed to lead the trade body at a \"very difficult time\".

Energy giant Saudi Aramco posted a 44.6-percent slump in third-quarter profit as the coronavirus pandemic weighs heavily on the global demand for crude oil. Aramco, seen as Saudi Arabia's cash cow, revealed consecutive falls in quarterly profits since it began disclosing earnings last year, piling pressure on government finances as it pursues ambitious multi-billion dollar projects to diversify the oil-reliant economy. The world's most valuable listed company said on Tuesday it was committed to a bumper dividend even as third quarter net profits dropped to $11.79 billion, compared to $21.3 billion in the same period last year. Aramco's net profit for the first nine months of this year also dropped 48.6 percent to $35.02 billion, the company said. The latest results are in line with analysts' expectations but stand in contrast to the losses reported by Aramco's rivals, which are reeling from pandemic-driven economic shutdowns that have suppressed energy requirements. Although the results underscore a downbeat market, Aramco's July-September results showed an improvement amid relatively steady crude prices compared to the second quarter, when it posted a profit of $6.57 billion. \"We saw early signs of a recovery in the third quarter due to improved economic activity, despite the headwinds facing global energy markets,\" Aramco's chief executive Amin Nasser said in the statement. \"We continue to adopt a disciplined and flexible approach to capital allocation in the face of market volatility.

The defence started the five-day hearing on Monday by saying that the crux of the US charges against Meng - that she hid Huawei's relationship with former subsidiary Skycom in Iran from HSBC bank - is false and lacks context. Meng's lawyer, Scott Fenton, accused the United States of having \"breached its duty to be forthright and candid.\" \"The misstatements [and] omissions in the record of the case,\" he told the Supreme Court of British Columbia, \"go to the very heart of the fraud case.\" As such, he said, the extradition proceedings should be halted.

The US national debt is projected to exceed its previous post-World War II record high over the next four-year presidential term, and be double the size of the US economy in 30 years. US debt is currently at $27.2 trillion dollars. The November 3 Presidential election\u2019s winner will be immediately confronted with the need to put America\u2019s economic affairs in order. For voters across America, the different economic platforms and promises made by President Donald Trump and Presidential hopeful Joe Biden play a significant role in informing their vote. Public Debt The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent group, compared the pitches made by the two Presidential contenders, suggesting that \u2018both plans would substantially add to the debt\u2019, with little difference between them. The CRFB assesses that Trump\u2019s economic plan would increase debt by $4.95 trillion over ten years, compared to Vice President Biden\u2019s plan, which would increase the public deficit by $5.6 trillion in the same period. But that doesn\u2019t say much on its own. Each economic plan consists of multiple measures to stimulate the economy, so even an expensive budget that yields a higher GDP (gross domestic product) could be described as a good step. Instead, economists also look at the amount of total debt compared to the total size of the US economy. The key question is will this budget increase our existing debt, or reduce it?

A few years ago when the Italian mobsters decided to register a company in the UK to move their illegal funds, they didn\u2019t bother themselves with too much detail. They registered a company called Magnolia Fundaction UK and nominated a director with an Italian name II Ladro di Gailline, which translated into \u201cThe Chicken Thief\u201d. If that wasn\u2019t enough, they mentioned his profession as a tuffatore, which means a \u2018fraudster\u2019. Another director registered his address in Italian that translated into \u201c0, Street of the 40 Theives\u201d in some fictional Italian city of \u201cAli Babba\u201d. Over the years, journalists and NGOs have highlighted the ease with which people can register companies in the UK without drawing attention of the regulators. Take another example: Oliver Bullough, an investigative journalist, exposed the vulnerability of the system by registering a company named \u2018 Crooked Crook Crook Limited \u2019. No one flagged the name and he received the relevant documents in 36 hours. The recently leaked documents of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an arm of the US Treasury, has once again highlighted the role of the UK's financial system in helping money launderers. The leaks are based on Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), which some of the leading global banks filed with FinCEN between 1999 and 2017. Banks file SARs if they suspect that a transaction can violate a law - especially the US regulations for sanctions. More than 3,200 companies, which surfaced in the SARs were registered in the UK - more than any other country. Most of them are shell companies. A shell company is a fictitious entity, which basically exists on paper. Although some businesses use them for legitimate purposes, they also work as a conduit to hide ill-gotten wealth.

TikTok has told an Australian government committee that it will allow government officials to review its algorithm and test its source code, as it seeks to overcome distrust surrounding the video-streaming app operator's China ownership. TikTok's owner ByteDance has reached a deal with Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc that it hopes will end US plans to ban TikTok in the United States on security grounds. It said the deal will see the creation of a standalone US firm, TikTok Global, that does not involve any transfer of technology, though Oracle will be able to inspect TikTok source code. TikTok's Australian executives appeared in Canberra on Friday before the Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media, where they said the computer instructions that guide the content presented to TikTok users would be made more widely available for inspection. \"(It will be) available in a public setting for regulators, governments, commercial entities to come in and to test our code\", Global Chief Security Officer Roland Cloutier said via video link.

Libya's National Oil Company has said it expected oil production to rise to 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) next week, as the OPEC member looks to revive its oil industry, crippled by a blockade since January. Oil prices fell around 5 percent on Monday, partly due to the potential return of Libyan barrels to a market that's already grappling with the prospect of collapsing demand from rising coronavirus cases. Libya produced around 1.2 million bpd, over 1 percent of global production, before the blockade, which slashed the OPEC member's output to around 100,000 bpd. It was unclear how quickly Libya could ramp up production.

A US judge in Washington has temporarily blocked a Trump administration order banning Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google from offering Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok for download that was set to take effect at 11:59 pm Sunday (03.59 GMT Monday). The ruling followed an emergency hearing on Sunday morning in which lawyers for TikTok argued that the administration's app-store ban would infringe on the company's First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business. The 90-minute hearing came after President Donald Trump declared this summer that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it either sold its US operations to US companies or the app would be barred from the country. TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is scrambling to firm up a deal tentatively struck a week ago in which it would partner with tech company Oracle and retailer Walmart and that would get the blessing of the Chinese and American governments.

Chief executive Elon Musk and the head of Tesla's power team laid out battery design, material and production innovations that combine to cut the cost per kilowatt hours by 56 percent. New approaches to making lithium-ion batteries for vehicles are desperately needed given the limited supply and cost, Musk said during a \"Battery Day\" presentation. Tesla shares dropped about six percent in after-market trades as investors learned the road ahead was not short. Musk had put out word on Twitter that Battery Day announcements would be \"insane,\" driving high expectations. During the presentation, Musk and energy engineering senior vice president Drew Baglino laid out technical details of Tesla's overhaul of making batteries, from raw materials and design to building finished cells into the very structures of cars. Innovations, some still in development, were expected to pack more energy into battery cells, cut production costs and dramatically extend battery life.

Oreka bridges the gap as a mid-partner between premium food producers and sellers. In essence, when markets, cafes,and patisseries have surplus product at the end of the day, Oreka are able to discount the goods by 50 percent, or more, sometimes, and offer them to be purchased by users of their app. Once they have done this, the buyer can go directly to the vendor, a cafe, for example, in person to collect the goods. \u201cOreka helps food sellers monetise unsold food and gain new customers, while aiding customers buy premium goods at a discount,\u201d Rizo says. \u201cNot to mention there is the environmental impact: there is less loss of food at the end of the day.\u201d The partners attended a Sustainable Food Summit in Istanbul in 2019 and the idea for the Oreka app was born.

Names of five financia l giants including HSBC, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and the Bank of New York Mellon have surfaced in thousands of documents leaked to BuzzFeed News and shared with an international group of investigative reporters. The leaked files come from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) which is part of the US Treasury.

Criminals, including suspected terrorists, transferred more than $2 trillion via these banks between 1999 and 2017, raising concern about the loopholes in the system that is meant to stop money laundering, according to reports. Most of the information in the documents comes from the banks themselves. Banks dealing in US dollars have to abide by Washington\u2019s guidelines on money laundering.

The British government has launched a new employment programme aimed at helping those left jobless due to the Covid-19 pandemic to get back into work. The Department for Work and Pensions said on Monday the Job Entry Targeted Support (JETS) scheme would be backed by a 238 million pound ($308 million) investment. The ministry said jobseekers put forward for the scheme would have access to tailored, flexible support to quickly get back into employment. This could involve specialist advice on how people could move into growing sectors, as well as coaching on CVs and interviews. \"JETS will give recently unemployed people the helping hand they need to get back into work, boosting the prospects of more than a quarter of a million people across Britain,\" said Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Therese Coffey. A government subsidy scheme for workers on furlough is due to expire on October 31 and be replaced with a less comprehensive job support scheme. Economists have warned that unemployment risks rising sharply, with the Bank of England penciling in a jump in the jobless rate to 7.5%. The opposition Labour Party said the announcement on the JETS scheme was too little, too late. \"By the government's own admission at least 4 million people could lose their jobs during the crisis. All it can muster in response are piecemeal schemes and meaningless slogans,\" said Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's policy chief on work and welfare.

Talks between TikTok and government negotiators will continue even after the deadline passes, and people in the US will still be able to use the popular smartphone app for sharing video snippets, the source said. TikTok and the US Treasury, which oversees the committee on foreign investment, declined to comment.

The White House claims TikTok has links to the Chinese government through its parent firm ByteDance. TikTok has repeatedly defended itself against allegations of data transfers to the Chinese government. It says its servers where user information is stored are located in the United States and Singapore. A US federal judge in late October issued an injunction temporarily blocking an executive order by Trump aimed at banning TikTok, throwing up a legal roadblock. The judge's ruling hit the brakes on a Trump threat to knock TikTok offline by cutting it off from US businesses providing website hosting, data storage and other fundamentals needed to operate.

The benefits of Turkey's recent giant natural gas discovery in the Black Sea will be felt mostly in the medium and long term as the gas is expected to be ready for public consumption in 2023. As announced on Friday by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, some 320 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves were found after the drill ship Fatih started work on July 20 off the Black Sea coast. The size of the discovery dwarfs all the natural gas Turkey has ever produced (16.6 billion cubic meters), and is expected to be worth roughly $65 billion in value. Enver Erkan, an economist at Istanbul-based private investment firm Tera Yatirim, said after Erdogan teased the arrival of good news ushering in a \"new era\" in Turkey, energy shares and the Turkish lira both gained some ground. The US Dollar/Turkish lira exchange rate fell to around 7.20 ahead of the announcement, after hovering above 7.34 earlier in the week, but settled for the weekend at 7.34 after the announcement was made.

OPEC and a group of allied countries including Russia have agreed to increase oil production by 500,000 barrels per day from January and will meet monthly after that to decide whether to further adjust output. The decision on Thursday followed days of wrangling among the oil-producing countries over whether to increase output early next year at all after the pandemic sapped demand for energy this year and clouded the outlook for the industry. \"It has been decided to increase the amount of oil offered to the market from January 2021, with a total increase from OPEC+ countries of 500,000 barrels per day,\" the Kazakh energy ministry said in a statement at the end of video-conference of countries in the OPEC+ club. The OPEC members and a group of allies had made deep cuts in production last year to support prices as the pandemic sharply reduced demand for fuel.

The World Trade Organization's Goods Trade Barometer, a real-time trend gauge for trade, has confirmed a steep drop in trade. The WTO said on Wednesday its goods trade barometer hit a record low, suggesting global merchandise trade registered a historic fall in the second quarter of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic raged. \"Additional indicators point to partial upticks in world trade and output in the third quarter, but the strength of any such recovery remains highly uncertain: an L-shaped, rather than V-shaped, trajectory cannot be ruled out,\" the WTO said on its website. The barometer reading of 84.5 was down 18.6 points from the year-ago period. In normal times, it anticipates changes in the trajectory of trade by a few months, but volatility triggered by the pandemic has reduced its predictive value. \"This reading \u2013\u2013 the lowest on record in data going back to 2007, and on par with the nadir of the 2008-09 financial crisis \u2013\u2013 is broadly consistent with WTO statistics issued in June, which estimated an 18.5 percent decline in merchandise trade in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period last year,\" the WTO said. The exact extent of the fall will become clear only when official trade data for April to June become available. The WTO had forecast in April that global trade in goods would fall between 13 percent and 32 percent in 2020 before rebounding by 21-24 percent in 2021, but in June said rapid responses by governments meant its pessimistic scenario for this year was unlikely. \"The WTO's June statistics implied a 14 percent drop in global merchandise trade volume between the first and second quarters of this year.

The Washington-based development lender previously estimated that 60 million people would fall into extreme poverty due to Covid-19, but the new estimate puts the deterioration at 70 to 100 million, and , World Bank President David Malpass said \"that number could go higher\" if the pandemic worsens or drags on. The situation makes it \"imperative\" that creditors reduce the amount of debt held by poor countries at risk, going beyond the commitment to suspend debt payments, Malpass said in an interview. Even so, more countries will be obliged to restructure their debt. \"The debt vulnerabilities are high, and the imperative of getting light at the end of the tunnel so that new investors can come in is substantial,\" Malpass said. Advanced economies in the Group of 20 already have committed to suspending debt payments from the poorest nations through the end of the year, and there is growing support for extending that moratorium into next year amid a pandemic that's killed nearly 800,000 people and sickened more than 25 million worldwide.

Britain's public debt has gone above $2.65 trillion for the first time in July as the government ramped up public spending to cope with the coronavirus pandemic and tax revenues fell. Net debt, excluding public banks, rose to $2.66 trillion, up by nearly $304 billion from July 2019 and equivalent to 100.5% of Britain's economic output, its highest since 1961. Borrowing in the April-July period, the first four months of the financial year, surged to $199 billion, almost three times borrowing by the government during the previous financial year as a whole, the Office for National Statistics said. In July alone, borrowing excluding public sector banks was 26.7 billion pounds, slightly less than the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.

The company, owned by China-based ByteDance, also launched a new @tiktok_comms Twitter account to address issues in real time. As tensions soar between the world's two biggest economies, Trump has claimed TikTok could be used by China to track the locations of federal employees, build dossiers on people for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage. The US leader early this month also ordered a ban on the messaging app WeChat which is used extensively in China. On Friday, Trump signed a separate executive order for"}

The transportation minister also said new railway investments will make Turkey a logistical powerhouse. Turkey has numerous freight and high-speed train projects currently, he added. The freight transportation via railways, which is currently 30 million tons annually, will reach 45 million tons in 2023 and 150 million tons in 2028, he stressed. The ministry contributes to the manufacturing and tourism sectors by strengthening investments and easing ways of transportation, he said.

EU leaders have agreed on an $858 billion or 750 billion-euro recovery fund backed by common borrowing to support the economy from 2021. National governments have stepped in with loans to keep businesses afloat and wage support programmes that pay workers' salaries while they are furloughed.

Fitch Ratings has revised the outlook on the United States' triple-A rating to negative from stable, citing eroding credit strength, including a growing deficit to finance stimulus to combat fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The credit rating agency also said on Friday the future direction of US fiscal policy depends in part on the November election for president and the resulting makeup of Congress, cautioning there is a risk policy gridlock could continue. Debt and deficits, which were already rising before the pandemic, have started to erode the country's traditional credit strengths, Fitch said in a report. \"Financing flexibility, assisted by Federal Reserve intervention to restore liquidity to financial markets, does not entirely dispel risks to medium-term debt sustainability, and there is a growing risk that US policymakers will not consolidate public finances sufficiently to stabilise public debt after the pandemic shock has passed,\" Fitch said. It added that US government debt, the highest among any AAA-rated sovereign nations heading into the crisis, was expected to exceed 130 percent of gross domestic product by 2021. Credit rating agencies often use changes in outlooks to signal possible future moves in the overall rating. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the deficit for this budget year, which ends September 30, will surge to an all-time high of $3.7 trillion.

In releasing a draft of a mandatory code of conduct on Friday, the government aims to succeed where other countries have failed in making the global digital giants pay for news siphoned from commercial media companies.

The draft will be open to consultation until August 28, with the legislation to be introduced to Parliament soon after, Frydenberg said. As well as payment, the code covers issues including access to user data and transparency of algorithms used to rank and present media content.

Throughout the session, they faced one recurring question: are their companies too big, and too powerful? Members of Congress hammered Pichai about his company's ties to China and whether it steals ideas from other businesses. Zuckerberg faced tough questions about a flurry of disinformation plaguing his social network.

It is certainly a concession: the IATA\u2019s previous estimate predicted passenger traffic would return to pre-pandemic levels within the next three years. A resurgence of virus cases in countries such as Spain and Italy, partly blamed on the resumption of international tourism, further helps to dash the hopes of an aviation industry that is on its knees. \u201cNothing...nothing of this scale has ever occurred to aviation.

New Zealand has fallen into its deepest economic slump on record in the second quarter as its battle against the coronavirus pandemic paralysed business activity. Gross domestic product contracted a seasonally adjusted 12.2 percent quarter-on-quarter, its sharpest quarterly contraction on record and largely in line with forecasts of a 12.8 percent decline from economists polled by Reuters. GDP fell 12.4 percent year-on-year, official data showed on Thursday. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand had forecast a quarterly and annual GDP decline of 14 percent in its August statement. Growth has been hit by a standstill in economic activity as a strict nationwide coronavirus lockdown in April and parts of May forced almost everyone to stay at home and businesses to shut. The GDP data confirms New Zealand's worst recession, defined as two straight quarters of contraction, since 2010, with GDP in the March quarter falling 1.6 percent. Record breaking rise ahead? In comparison, second quarter economic growth in neighbouring Australia which enforced a less stringent Covid-19 lockdown fell 7.0 percent, while the United States recorded a 9.1 percent drop. But economists say New Zealand will bounce back faster, while other nations are still struggling to contain the coronavirus. \"We expect the June quarter\u2019s record-breaking GDP decline to be followed by a record-breaking rise in the September quarter,\" said Westpac Senior Economist Michael Gordon. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government, which faces an election on October 17, has said success in suppressing the virus locally is likely to help recovery prospects.

EU leaders are set to hold video talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday, hoping to make progress on trade and investment, even as tensions mount between Beijing and the West over Hong Kong and the treatment of minority Uighurs. The virtual meeting between top Chinese officials and EU Council President Charles Michel, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, replaces a full summit with all 27 European leaders which had to be cancelled because of coronavirus. China has said an investment deal already seven years in the making can be agreed by the end of the year, but EU officials warn significant obstacles remain and insist they will not agree to unfavourable terms simply to cut a deal. \"Even if there is a political objective to accelerate negotiations and conclude them by the end of the year, we will have this only if it is something worth having,\" an EU official said. 'Significant progress' Brussels says \"significant progress\" has been made in talks since a similar video summit in June, and officials hope to agree a \"roadmap\" to get a deal done by the end of the year, but they also warn Beijing needs to do more to improve market access for European companies.

Rio Tinto announced the resignation of its CEO and two top officials over the mining giant's destruction of a 46,000-year-old indigenous site to expand an iron ore mine in Australia. The Anglo-Australian firm faced a growing investor revolt over the destruction of the sacred site in the Juukan Gorge in Western Australia's remote Pilbara region, one of the earliest known locations inhabited by Australia's indigenous people. Following a board investigation into the May 24 incident, Rio Tinto said on Friday that CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques was stepping down \"by mutual agreement\" along with the chief of the company's core iron ore division, Chris Salisbury, and corporate relations head Simone Niven. \"What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,\" chairman Simon Thompson said in a statement. The cultural importance of Juukan Gorge was confirmed by an archaeological dig carried out at one of the caves, known as rock shelters, a year after Rio Tinto obtained approval to blast in the area. The dig uncovered the oldest known example of bone tools in Australia, a sharpened kangaroo bone dating back 28,000 years, and a plaited-hair belt that DNA testing linked to indigenous people still living in the area. An internal company review in August determined that \"a series of decisions, actions and omissions over an extended period of time\" preceded the choice to go ahead with the Juukan Gorge blasting despite concerns over the fate of the sacred indigenous site. In an initial response, the company stripped millions of dollars in bonuses from the three executives. But the firm's shareholders and corporate responsibility bodies derided the move as insufficient and called for heads to roll. 'Crucial first step' The National Native Title Council, which represents indigenous landowners, welcomed what it called the \"dismissal\" of the Rio Tinto executives, but said such staff"}

Tech giant Microsoft has said its offer to buy TikTok was rejected , leaving Oracle as the sole remaining bidder ahead of a looming deadline for the Chinese-owned video app to sell or shut down its US operations. The Wall Street Journal a nd New York Times reported that Oracle had won the bidding war, citing people familiar with the deal, although the company did not immediately confirm the matter to AFP. The Oracle bid would next need approval from the White House and Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a source told the Journal, with both parties under the belief it would meet US data security concerns. TikTok has been at the center of a diplomatic storm between Washington and Beijing, and President Donald Trump has given Americans a deadline to stop doing business with TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance \u2013 effectively compelling a sale of the app to a US company. Microsoft had indicated at the beginning of August that it was interested in acquiring TikTok's US operations, but said Sunday that bid had been rejected. \"ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok's US operations to Microsoft,\" the US tech giant said in a statement. \"We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests,\" it added.

China's GDP grew 4.9 percent in the third quarter, data showed Monday, building on a strong recovery from painful coronavirus lockdowns. However, the expansion fell short of forecasts and officials warned of uncertainty as the disease continues to ravage other key markets, with the National Bureau of Statistics saying \"the international environment is still complicated\". Subdued reaction China stocks reversed earlier gains to close lower on Monday, weighed down by industrial and healthcare firms, after the weaker-than-forecast GDP growth for the third quarter. Some Asian markets rose on lingering hopes for a new US stimulus package.

Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has launched two inquiries into Facebook Inc after the social network giant's handling of children's personal data on Instagram raised concerns. The DPC, the main data privacy regulator in the European Union, received complaints from individuals and had identified \"potential concerns\" in relation to the processing of children's data on Instagram, Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in an emailed statement on Sunday. Both inquiries were launched last month, Doyle said. Facebook did not immediately respond when contacted by Reuters on Sunday. READ MORE: Facebook may be forced to stop sending EU customers data to US The Telegraph , which first reported the inquiry, said Instagram made the email addresses and phone numbers of users under 18 public. The Irish regulator launched its probe following a complaint by David Stier, a US data scientist, The Telegraph added. The first inquiry looks to establish if Facebook has the legal basis to process the data and whether it employs adequate protections and/or restrictions on Instagram. \"This inquiry will also consider whether Facebook meets its obligations as a data controller with regard to transparency requirements in its provision of Instagram to children,\" Doyle said. Instagram's profile and account settings will be the focus of the second inquiry, examining whether the social media company is adhering to the regulator's data protection requirements.

Britain's data protection watchdog has fined British Airways nearly $25 million (\u00a320 million) \u2013 its biggest such penalty to date \u2013 for failing to protect data that left more than 400,000 of its customers' details the subject of a 2018 cyber attack.

BA said in a statement that it had alerted customers as soon as it became aware of the attack. The penalty was considerably less than the $237 million (183.4 million pounds) the ICO proposed last year \u2013 in part reflecting the crisis the airline industry is now facing due to coronavirus.

The California-based company tweeted earlier: \"We had some trouble with our internal systems and don't have any evidence of a security breach or hack.\" According to downdetector.com, users on every continent had reported being unable to use the platform, but the outages were concentrated on the east and west coasts of the United States, as well as Japan.

The company this week took the dramatic step of reducing the reach of a New York Post article critical of Biden, drawing a harsh rebuke from conservatives. Thursday's outage was the latest technical breakdown to knock Twitter offline. The platform experienced an hour-long outage in July 2019, one lasting several hours a year ago and yet another last February. More worrisome are hacking attacks on popular social media platforms like Twitter. In July, prominent Americans including former president Barack Obama, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Tesla chief Elon Musk saw their Twitter accounts hacked. The attack targeted at least 130 accounts, with tweets posted by the intruders duping people into sending $100,000 in Bitcoin, supposedly in exchange for double the amount sent. Several people aged 17 to 22 have since been charged for the hack, in which they targeted Twitter employees for personal passcodes to get into the company's internal systems.

Ericsson, unlike Nokia, has won contracts from all three major operators in China to supply radio equipment for 5G networks, and could be at risk if the Chinese government decides to retaliate \"It could be that some of the European vendors will sell less in China going forward if the Chinese are selling less in Europe going forward,\" CEO Kjell Johnsen of Swedish-based telecom operator Tele2 said in a post-earnings conference call.

Microsoft had first announced the device last October. Microsoft Corp has announced that the Surface Duo, its dual-screen smartphone powered by Alphabet Inc's Android operating system, will start at a price of $1,399 and arrive in stores beginning September 10. The Surface Duo folds closed like a book. Unlike devices such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy Z Fold 2 that use special flexible glass to create a single display, the Duo has two traditional screens separated by a hinge but synchronised to work together. At a media briefing ahead of the Surface Duo announcement, Microsoft executives positioned the phone as a tool for getting work done with its productivity apps, similar to how many business users employ dual-monitor setups with PCs. In the company's Teams chat app, for example, a video chat occupies one screen while the other screen displays chats. In Microsoft's Outlook email app, clicking a link in the body of an email opens the link on the opposite screen, so the user can continue reading or responding to the email. \"I'm not trying to reinvent the phone,\" Panos Panay, Microsoft's chief product officer, told reporters. \"But I do believe this is a better way to get things done.\" Pair up non-Microsoft apps The dual-screen setup also allows users to pair up non-Microsoft apps, such as running social networks Twitter and Instagram side by side. Panay said that one of Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella's favorite combinations was using Amazon.com's Kindle app to read books while taking notes with a stylus in Microsoft's OneNote app on the other screen.

The Trump administration has unveiled plans to auction off 100 megahertz of midband spectrum previously dedicated to military purposes for commercial use starting in mid-2022, to ramp up fifth-generation network coverage in the US. The Federal Communications Commission will be able to auction this spectrum to companies like Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc from December 2021, and the wireless industry could be using it by summer of the following year, White House adviser and US Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios told reporters. The move \"allows us to maximise 5G availability of spectrum without compromising national security,\" he said. The military uses the spectrum for critical radar operations including air missile defence, Department of Defence Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy said. 'Key milestone' Midband spectrum is seen as vital for 5G, because it offers both geographic coverage and the capacity to transmit large amounts of data, FCC chairman Ajit Pai has said. The next-generation 5G wireless network is expected eventually to connect and enable high-speed video transmissions and self-driving cars, among other uses. The FCC has been working to clear enough spectrum to make 5G networks a reality and ensure there is enough spectrum to handle the growing amount of internet and wireless traffic. This spectrum reassignment is part of that effort. Pai on Monday praised the announcement, adding that the FCC was looking forward to moving quickly to adopt service rules to bring the spectrum to market. \"This is a key milestone in securing United States leadership in 5G,\" Pai said. In October 2018, US President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing the Commerce Department to develop a long-term comprehensive national spectrum strategy to prepare for 5G wireless networks. Trump created the White House Spectrum Strategy Task Force and asked federal agencies to report on government spectrum needs and review how spectrum could be shared with private sector users.

An already fragile economy beset by a decade of political turmoil and lacklustre economic growth, was now facing an existential threat as it was cut off from global financial markets. One of the biggest challenges was to arrange money to pay for oil imports and keep cars, factories and aircrafts running, while tensions with neighbouring India deepened. \u201cThat\u2019s when Saudi Arabia came to our rescue and offered us an oil credit for the first time,\u201d recalls G.

We got the shipments on a deferred payment which means you take the oil today but paid much later. But really it was sort of a grant as the payments were waived off.\u201d Since then, Pakistani leaders have approached Riyadh on a number of occasions asking for similar relief whenever the country's foreign currency reserves have fallen, or it has struggled to settle international payments. The oil credit facility was renewed once again after Prime Minister Imran Khan came to power in 2018 and his government sought loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as other friendly countries in order to avert a balance of payments crisis. In November 2018, Saudi Arabia offered $6.2 billion in cash and credit to ease Pakistan\u2019s financial difficulties. Under the terms of the deal, Pakistan could import $3.2 billion worth of Saudi oil every year on credit. Generally, a buyer has to pay for an oil shipment within 30 days.

Gordon Moore, the co-founder of chip-maker Intel Corporation, is best known for predicting that the number of transistors on computer chips will double every two years. For decades his observation, known as Moore\u2019s law, remained valid. But now the company he helped found is violating the same \u2018law\u2019. Last week Intel announced that its next generation of chips would be delayed by around a year as the world\u2019s biggest chip maker struggles to sort out production and design issues. The 7-nanometer based processor was originally planned to be launched in early 2022. Now, its launch may be delayed as late as 2023. The Santa Clara-based company has indicated that it might have to rely on third-party manufacturers to bring the products to market at the right time and price. What went wrong? Intel remains the world\u2019s leader when it comes to producing microprocessors for personal computers. A generation has grown up using Intel processors in their PCs. It could easily lose its position as a leader in introducing cutting-edge processing speed. In the last two years, it has faced delays in rolling out products from its factories and has lagged behind competitors in the design of more advanced chips. Asian competitors, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung, are racing ahead with plans to launch sophisticated 5-nanometer versions. TSMC is already mass-producing this particular chip, which will be used in 5G iPhones. The term nanometer is used for the size of the transistors - as the size gets smaller, more transistors can be squeezed together, adding to overall computing power. Intel has mostly relied on in-house manufacturing in a bid to better control the process of squeezing more computing power into tiny spaces. Its management had to face embarrassment two years back after repeated delays in bringing its current 10 nanometer generation chips to the market.

In the world of investments, gold is once again all the rage. On Monday, the spot price hit an all-time high of $1,945 per ounce in the intra-day trade after rising for seven consecutive weeks. The surge comes on the back of a weakening US dollar, US-China trade tensions and low interest rates which are near zero - giving investors a reason to find assets that appreciate in value. Gold has not disappointed. While gold does not yield interest like other financial instruments such as a bond, it tends to increase in value in times of turmoil. And there\u2019s no shortage of that these days. The coronavirus pandemic, which has battered economies around the world, and killed more than 648,000 people, has forced central banks to slash interest rates. Trillions of dollars have flooded the markets as part of stimulus programmes. When so much money floods the markets, there\u2019s always concern that it will stoke inflation and result in currencies to fall. In such circumstances, gold is always a good hedge. The last time the gold price was this high was in 2011. That peak also followed a bad time for the global economy after the 2008 recession. The period also saw governments and central banks pumping money into the markets. Demand for gold generally goes up in times of uncertainty as people move savings to more secure assets that preserve their value for a longer duration. Analysts at the Bank of America in April even predicted that in 18 months the price could hit $3,000 an ounce or 28.3 grams, the result of an ever-devalued currency given the rate at which central banks are printing money. A close link During these last few pandemic-hit months, the price of gold has closely responded to the economic outlook and news coming out of the US. This week, the US Federal Reserve System, or the Fed, is meeting to decide the interest rate. Analysts expect that it will keep the rate at the"}

The UAE said it would \"put its legal case to ICAO supporting the right to close its airspace to Qatari aircraft.\" The ICAO in 2018 ruled it had the jurisdiction to handle the dispute brought by Qatar, which accused its neighbours of violating a convention that regulates the free passage of its passenger planes through foreign airspace.

Turkey is setting itself up to become more self-sufficient and less dependent on the international supply chain in a post-coronavirus period in a liberal world order. The country's Senior Presidential Advisor Gulnur Aybet stated that Ankara's model is not mercantilist, but instead increases regional and global trade. She was speaking during a joint webinar with the Turkish Heritage Organization and Atlantic Council. \u201cWe see [Turkey] is becoming more self-sufficient [in post-coronavirus period]. It has much more robust relations all around the globe and it trades globally. \"Turkey, with a fast-growing economy, being a trading state is much more immersed, and the practices of a global liberal order than it was before during the Cold War.\" Aybet noted that the world has passed three phase after World War II. During the Cold War and post-Cold War periods, Turkey was not a \"real strategic partner\" but its location and as the second largest army of NATO made it quite functional, she added. She stressed that the transatlantic centre, which consists of Europe and the US, is beneficial for countries in the liberal world order, but their exclusionary and imposing policies has harmed the principles and values that they have created in the system. \"I don't think we have core-periphery anymore in this system, but the assumptions behind this are still very much there. If the liberal world order system seizes to be liberal, it becomes a system of imposing norms and that goes against the very thing you are trying to build,\" Aybet said. During the post-coronavirus era, she noted, the importance of international institutions such as NATO will continue, but the perception of security threats will differentiate which Turkey-US relations will need to be relooked at."}

The number of laid-off workers seeking unemployment benefits remained stuck at 1.3 million last week, a historically high level that indicates many companies are still cutting jobs as the viral outbreak intensifies. The elevated level of applications for jobless aid is occurring as new confirmed cases of coronavirus are spiking across much of the Sunbelt, threatening to weaken the economic recovery. Case counts are rising in 40 states and 22 states have either paused or reversed their efforts to reopen their economies, according to Bank of America. Rising infections paralleled rising applications for aid in some states getting hit right now, and fell in states with declining infections. In Florida, claims doubled to 129,000, and in Georgia they rose nearly one-third to 136,000, according to the Labor Department's Thursday report. In California they increased 23,000 to nearly 288,000. Applications also rose in Arizona and South Carolina.

In tweets from its support account and an updated blog post, Twitter said on Wednesday it had no indication that the private messages of any other elected officials were obtained.

In general, someone with the ability to tweet from an account would also be able to read previously sent or received messages that had not been deleted. That would make it likely that some of the most famous people in the world had private messages read by hackers still at large. The FBI is investigating the case from its San Francisco office. Twitter previously said that the attackers downloaded mass data from eight accounts, none of them the verified accounts with blue checks that include famous people, officials and some in the media.

A requirement for the prestigious Wall Street index is four successive profitable quarters, which Tesla has now achieved. Tesla shares, which have exploded in 2020 as the company has met key targets, climbed further following the results. Several analysts that have praised Tesla's accomplishments view the rise in valuation as excessive. Musk praised Tesla's staff for \"exceptional execution\" during a period that included the weeks-long closure of its California plant due to the coronavirus pandemic and said he looked forward to \"continue scaling\" Tesla up to enable production levels closer to that of conventional auto giants. \"I've never been more optimistic or excited about the future of Tesla,\" Musk said on a conference call with analysts and investors. Musk, who has long flouted the unwritten rules of button-down CEOs, avoided the sort of fights with analysts that have occasionally surfaced on conference calls.

While the jobless rate was down from 13.3 percent in May, it is still at a Depression-era level.

Record high numbers The news came as the number of confirmed infections per day in the US soared to an all-time high of 50,700, more than doubling over the past month, according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins University. The spike, centred primarily in the South and West, has led states such as California, Texas, Arizona and Florida to re-close or otherwise clamp down again on bars, restaurants, movie theatres, beaches and swimming pools, throwing some workers out of a job for a second time.

The suit filed in a courthouse in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose on Tuesday seeks class action status and names as defendants the leading video sharing platform and its parent companies Google and Alphabet. \"Under the pretext of finding that videos violate some vague, ambiguous, and non- specific video content rule, defendants use computer driven racial, identity and viewpoint profiling and filtering tools to restrict, censor, and denigrate\" blacks, the suit argued.

A World Trade Organization panel ruled Tuesday that Riyadh failed to protect intellectual property rights of Qatari-owned broadcaster beIN by refusing to take action against a Saudi pirate TV outfit. The WTO established the panel in December 2018 to settle the dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which has been locked in a bitter feud with its Gulf neighbours after the severing of diplomatic ties a year earlier. Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain, abruptly cut diplomatic, economic and travel ties with Qatar in June 2017, insisting it was too close to Iran and funding radical Islamist movements. Qatar fiercely rejected those allegations and refused to budge on 13 demands made by its allies-turned-adversaries, including closure of the Doha-based Al Jazeera news network and shutting a Turkish military base in the emirate. In Tuesday's case, Qatar had accused Saudi Arabia of blocking Qatari-owned broadcaster beIN and not taking proper action against the theft of its content by a Saudi-based piracy outlet called \" beoutQ \". The WTO panel found that Saudi Arabia had not provided for domestic criminal procedures and penalties to be applied to beoutQ , and that Riyadh prevented beIN from obtaining Saudi legal counsel to enforce its IP rights through the Saudi judicial system.

A Turkish court on Friday released four pilots and a private airline official from jail, pending the outcome of their trial on charges of smuggling former Nissan Motor Co chairman Carlos Ghosn out of Japan to Lebanon, via Turkey. The court, however, barred the five from leaving Turkey and ordered them to report to authorities at regular intervals. Ghosn, once a leading light of the global car industry, was arrested in Japan in late 2018 and charged with underreporting his salary and using company funds for personal purposes, charges he denies. The ousted chairman of the alliance of Renault, Nissan Motor Co and Mitsubishi Motors Corp had been awaiting his trial under house arrest in Japan when he escaped in December via Istanbul to Beirut, his childhood home. Migrant smuggling charges An executive from Turkish private jet operator MNG Jet and four pilots were detained in early January soon after Ghosn's escape and charged with migrant smuggling, a charge carrying a maximum sentence of eight years in jail. They appeared in white protective overalls, masks and gloves as a measure against the coronavirus, as the court in Istanbul began hearing their defence. Two flight attendants, charged with failing to report a crime, which could incur a sentence of up to one year, were also there. All seven defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Kosemen said in court on Friday he was only told via phone about Ghosn's presence on the plane during its flight to Istanbul and that he cooperated under duress, believing his family could be in danger.

Tulips, allium flowers, grass and insects sketch their own natural painting at Pascale Malilo van Clooster's orchard just outside Brussels city centre. Lulled by a soft wind, these flowers are a treasure trove for plump bees that dive inside in the avid search for pollen. Creating a biodiversity heaven for pollinators was one of Malilo van Clooster's goals when she started her sustainable flowers business four years ago in Linkebeek, a green suburban area on the outskirts of the Belgian capital. Malilo van Clooster's orchard is part of Cycle Farm, an urban garden that includes larger land parcels devoted to vegetable farming. On a sunny June day, the flowers are ready to be picked up by environmentally conscious clients who seek a local, pesticide-free alternative for their bouquets. All flowers here bloom from organic seeds originating from Belgium or nearby France and England. They're grown without pesticides and only according to their natural life cycle, Malilo van Clooster explains. This means the orchard is closed in the winter months. \"I plant my flowers according to their blooming season. I don't sow seeds that wouldn't be able to blossom at that particular time of the year,\" says Malilo van Clooster. \"We have access to a greenhouse that works as nursery and that can help a bit (with the flowers' development) but the greenhouse isn't heated and I don't work out of the seasonal schedule so I can't say 'here, I have large quantities in the month of December'.

It's easy for them to transport flower seeds to the vegetable garden nearby where wild flowers grow in between snow peas and broccoli. Sometimes flowers blossom spontaneously.

Japan\u2019s cabinet approved the record budget proposal on Monday for the next fiscal year from April, including a stimulus for the pandemic-hit economy. The budget proposal totals $1.03 trillion (106.6 trillion yen), a 3.8 percent rise from the current year and the ninth straight annual increase. The defence ministry will get a record $51.7 billion (5.34 trillion yen) for the year starting in April, up 1.1 percent from this year. With Suga's large majority in parliament, enactment of the budget is all but certain.

The coronavirus has forced Japan's notoriously fussy food shoppers to abandon doubts about online grocery stores, sending retailers such as Aeon Co scrambling to meet a surge in delivery demand. Although Japanese shoppers aren't alone in going online during the outbreak, the shift is remarkable for a country that had been expected to take years to embrace online food shopping because of a zeal for fresh and perfectly presented produce. \"I think that this pandemic has triggered an inflection point in the adoption of grocery e-commerce,\" said Luke Jensen, executive director of Ocado Group, hired to build a grocery e-commerce business for Japanese retail giant Aeon. Most companies won't disclose numbers, but retail executives and analysts estimate internet sales now account for about 5 percent or more of Japan's total grocery sales, compared with 2.5 percent before the pandemic. Although that is still lower than some pre-crisis estimates of 15 percent in China and even 7 percent in broadband laggard Britain, it challenges a long-held belief that Japanese shoppers will always on shopping daily and in person, checking the goods first-hand.

Commerce is putting more than 60 other firms on the list for such things as allegedly supporting the Chinese military, being involved in the theft of trade secrets and aiding Beijing\u2019s efforts to claim territory in the South China Sea.

NSO has argued that, because it sells digital break-in tools to police and spy agencies, it should benefit from \"sovereign immunity\" \u2013 a legal doctrine that generally insulates foreign governments from lawsuits.

The EU and Britain are back to haggling over Brexit with Britain giving ultimatums over a free-trade deal and the bloc warning the Brits to respect the original terms of the divorce. The recent crisis was triggered after Britain warned the European Union that it could effectively override the divorce deal it signed unless the bloc agrees to a free-trade deal by October 15. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has brushed off fears about \"no-deal\" chaos if talks fail. To further complicate things, in one of the most startling turns of the four-year Brexit saga, Britain has been reportedly planning new legislation that will override key parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement \u2013 a step that, if implemented, could jeopardise a treaty signed in January and stoke tension in Northern Ireland. EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned on Monday that withdrawal terms that Britain agreed to before formally exiting the European Union \"must be respected\". Sections of the internal market bill, due to be published on Wednesday, are expected to \"eliminate the legal force of parts of the withdrawal agreement\" in areas including state aid and Northern Ireland customs, the Financial Times said , citing three people familiar with the plans. No-deal? No fears, says Boris Britain left the now 27-nation EU on January 31, three-and-a-half years after the country narrowly voted to end more than four decades of membership.

The advertiser boycott of Facebook has morphed into a global digital activist campaign aimed at curbing hateful and toxic content on the social media giant. But its impact remains unclear. The unprecedented move has been joined by major brands like Unilever, Starbucks, Levis and Coca-Cola, with nearly 200 firms pausing advertising on the world's leading social network, and has wiped out billions in Facebook's market value. Some companies have signed on to the #StopHateForProfit campaign organised by social justice activists, while others have simply acted on their own to avoid the toxic atmosphere of Facebook. Ford, for example, said it would pause all social media advertising to \"re-evaluate our presence on these platforms\", adding that \"content that includes hate speech, violence and racial injustice on social platforms needs to be eradicated\".

The virus aid talks remained on track, both sides said, but closing out final disagreements was proving difficult. Weekend sessions were on tap, and House leaders hoped for a vote on Sunday on the massive package, which wraps much of Capitol Hill's unfinished 2020 business into a take-it-or-leave-it behemoth that promises to be a foot thick \u2013 or more. The House passed the temporary funding bill by a 320-60 vote. The Senate approved it by voice vote almost immediately afterward, sending it to President Donald Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said both sides remain intent on closing the deal, even as Democrats launched a concerted campaign to block an effort by Republicans to rein in emergency Federal Reserve lending powers. The Democrats said the GOP proposal would deprive President-elect Joe Biden of crucial tools to manage the economy.

House lawmakers were told they wouldn\u2019t have to report to work on Saturday but that a Sunday session was likely. The Senate will be voting on nominations.

India's economic growth has suffered a historic 23.9 percent decline, its worst performance in at least 24 years, official figures showed, as manufacturing and productivity were battered by a strict coronavirus lockdown. The contraction between April and June was the biggest since New Delhi started publishing quarterly statistics in 1996, and the latest figures came as the country's coronavirus cases surged past 3.6 million. The steep dip in Asia's third-largest economy reflected the impact of a months-long nationwide shutdown that saw most industrial and manufacturing activity grind to a halt. The virus restrictions dealt a severe blow to an economy already struggling with a protracted slowdown through 2019, hit by the twin shocks of shrinking consumer demand and rising unemployment levels. The decline was worse than expected, with a survey of economists by Bloomberg earlier predicting a contraction of 18 percent. On Monday the government warned the figures could be revised further since the pandemic had also affected the ability to collect accurate data on economic activity. \"The entire quarter was spent in lockdown and it was a complete washout for the Indian economy,\" Mumbai-based economist Ashutosh Datar told AFP. He added that the economic gloom was unlikely to lift \"for the next few quarters\". \"We started publishing quarterly growth figures only from 1996 and this is the worst quarterly performance on record ever since,\" he said. The sudden shutdown from late March prompted a huge exodus by millions of migrant workers who fled cities for their villages due to a lack of food and money. Many have yet to return even as restrictions have eased, leaving factories struggling with labour shortages. About 19 million salaried people have lost their jobs since the 68-day lockdown began in late March, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent think tank.

Pakistan has blocked access to Tinder and several other dating apps in a bid to control \"immoral\" and \"indecent\" content, just days after regulators threatened to shut down YouTube for similar reasons. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said it had barred users from accessing Tinder, Grindr, SayHi, Tagged and Skout after the social networking apps failed to \"moderate ... content in accordance\" with Pakistan's laws Tuesday. The PTA said the ban addressed the \"negative effects of immoral/indecent content\".

TikTok has truly revolutionised how people express themselves via their smartphones. It is not the first app that allows users to create videos. However, its easy-to-edit tools, friendly interface, short video format and appeal among youngsters who want to break social and class barriers, has turned it into a global phenomenon. More than 750 million people use it in dozens of countries every day - they lip sync popular songs, show off their acrobatic ability, demonstrate cooking skills, or just film themselves spending time with a pet dog, among just about anything else of interest. In terms of popularity, it stands alongside Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. But now the United States is forcing the Beijing-based company ByteDance, which owns TikTok, to sell its US operation. Here we explain why that is happening: 1- Why is TikTok selling its US operations? Tiktok, an app founded by Chinese national Zhang Yiming, is not selling its operations - it is actually being forced to part ways with its US operation under pressure from US President Donald Trump. Trump announced his intention to ban the app on July 31 citing an as of yet unsubstantiated fear that the Chinese government could gain access to information belonging to American TikTok users. The US is by far the largest TikTok market in terms of revenue, which it generates by selling advertisements. In order to avoid the ban, investors behind privately-held ByteDance are encouraging Yiming to consider a US tech firm as a potential buyer. TikTok faced another setback, raising the possibility of its selloff, when Kevin Mayer, a former Walt Disney executive, resigned just three months after taking over as the app\u2019s CEO. He says it has become difficult to work in a politically charged environment. The US has in the past blocked Chinese firms from buying American companies and has even forced some to reverse a sale.

The US central bank has rolled out a major policy change that will let inflation rise to allow the economy to produce more jobs for the benefit of all workers, but especially lower-income families. The change means inflation can stay above the 2.0 percent target \"for some time\" before the Fed will need to act by raising interest rates, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday in a speech. The aim is to correct the \"shortfalls\" in achieving the Fed's goal of maximum employment, and a recognition that with changes in the global economy, a tight job market does not necessarily drive prices higher. \"This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labour market, particularly for many in low \u2013\u2013 and moderate \u2013\u2013income communities,\" he said, adding that the Fed is prepared to use \"our full range of tools to support the economy.\" 'Robust job market can be sustained' Prior to the coronavirus pandemic the US unemployment rate had hovered near 50-year lows at 3.5 percent, which brought many people back into the workforce as firms struggled to fill open positions. The policy shift, though telegraphed in recent statements, is a significant change for the Fed and central banking more generally, as inflation for decades has been the economic villain to be stamped out at every turn. But Powell, in his speech to the annual Jackson Hole monetary policy conference, said the past 10 years since the 2008 global financial crisis has shown that warnings about low unemployment causing price hikes were exaggerated. \"This change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation,\" he told the virtual conference.

TikTok, which has been downloaded 175 million times in the US and more than a billion times around the world, argued in the suit that Trump's order was a misuse of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act because the platform \u2013\u2013 on which users share often playful short-form videos \u2013\u2013 is not \"an unusual and extraordinary threat.\" READ MORE: TikTok sues Trump over pending ban order against app 'Political environment has sharply changed' Former Disney executive Mayer, who has only been in the post since May, said in a letter to staff that \"in recent weeks, as the political environment has sharply changed, I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for\". \"Against this backdrop, and as we expect to reach a resolution very soon, it is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave the company,\" he wrote. \"I understand that the role that I signed up for \u2013\u2013 including running TikTok globally \u2013\u2013 will look very different as a result of the US administration's action to push for a sell-off of the US business.\" TikTok said in a statement: \"We appreciate that the political dynamics of the last few"}

US retail giant Walmart has said that it had teamed with Microsoft to buy TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app that has come under fire from the administration of President Donald Trump. The app has been at the centre of a diplomatic storm between Washington and Beijing since Trump signed an executive order on August 6 giving Americans 45 days to stop doing business with its Chinese parent company ByteDance. The president claims TikTok could be used by China to track the locations of federal employees, build dossiers on people for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.

Facebook's French subsidiary has agreed to pay more than $118 million in back taxes, including a penalty, after a 10-year audit of its accounts by French tax authorities, the company has said. France, which is pushing hard to overhaul international tax rules on digital companies such as Facebook, Alphabet's Google, Apple and Amazon, has said the big tech groups pay too little tax in the country where they have significant sales. Current international tax rules legally allow companies to funnel sales generated in local markets in Europe to their regional headquarters. Some of the tech companies, including Facebook, have European or international headquarters based in countries with comparatively low corporate tax rates, such as Ireland. A Facebook spokesman said French tax authorities carried out an audit on Facebook's accounts over the 2009-2018 period, which resulted in an agreement by the subsidiary to pay a total $125 million.

Weary but relieved, European Union leaders agreed on an unprecedented $2.1 trillion (1.8 trillion-euro) budget and coronavirus recovery fund early on Tuesday, somehow finding unity after four days and nights of intense negotiation that saw threats of walkouts and fierce intransigence by the Netherlands.

It does not contain significant quantities of high-inducing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

He added that with cotton production in Pakistan declining due to various factors, hemp provided farmers with a viable alternative. In Pakistan, the consumption of alcohol is strictly forbidden for Muslims, many people are surprisingly open to using cannabis, with the spongy, black hash made from marijuana grown in the country's tribal belt and neighbouring Afghanistan the preferred variant of the drug. Across the subcontinent people have been cultivating cannabis and smoking hash for centuries. The plant predates the arrival of Islam in the region, with reference to cannabis appearing in the sacred Hindu Atharva Veda text describing its medicinal and ritual uses.

A South African court has ruled that a Kuwaiti firm could ship thousands of sheep to the Middle East, dealing a blow to animal welfare activists seeking to ban such exports on concerns that extreme heat could kill the animals en route. In the high court case, South Africa's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) sought an interim injunction to prevent Kuwaiti livestock exporter Al Mawashi from sailing a vessel loaded with sheep out of South Africa's East London port. In papers filed with the court, the NSPCA said cramped spaces and extreme heat had led to some animals being \"cooked alive\" on similar voyages across the Equator during the summer months. The court ruled on Tuesday that Al Mawashi could transport up to 56,000 sheep on the vessel \"to destinations in the Middle East.\" It gave no reason for dismissing the NSPCA's concern but ordered the government to ensure the transport of sheep and loading onto the vessel was in compliance with World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) regulations. \"We are currently planning to load the ship, and we look forward to finally opening the next procurement window,\" said Ilyaas Ally, managing director of Al Mawashi South Africa, in a statement. A lawyer for the NSPCA, which has been campaigning against Al Mawashi and its parent company, Livestock Transport and Trading Company (LTTC), since late last year, said it was considering whether to appeal the judgement. \"We are obviously not overjoyed by it,\" Dominique Lloyd said. The group wants to block all such exports during the summer season until the government introduces new regulations on how live animals are transported. Tuesday's court hearing was part of a larger push by the NSPCA for an outright ban on the exportation of animals by sea from South Africa anywhere north of the equator. That case is expected to be heard within 12 months."}

It also warned that subsidies offered during the pandemic \"will be targeted by criminals seeking to defraud public funding.\" Frauds involving medical equipment are also on the rise.

The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits likely dropped below 2 million last week for the first time since mid-March, but remains astonishingly high as companies adjust to an environment that has been significantly changed by Covid-19. Nevertheless, the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday would suggest the worst is over for the labour market, combined with data on Wednesday that showed a smaller-than-expected drop in private payrolls in May.

Many businesses had reopened by mid-May. Economists said the stubbornly high number of unemployment claims comes from a second wave of layoffs as businesses navigate weak demand, as well as some lingering backlogs at state unemployment offices overwhelmed by the flood of applications early in the shutdown. \"Many of the new claims reflect current layoffs, as the corporate sector more broadly begins to adjust to the altered outlook for the year ahead,\" said Lou Crandall, chief economist of Wrightson ICAP LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey. \"Even as the economy begins to reopen, new job losses continue to pile up.\" New claims for state unemployment benefits likely totalled a seasonally adjusted 1.8 million for the week ended May 30, down from 2.123 million the prior week, according to a Reuters survey of economists.

The global economy is facing \"staggeringly large\" losses and the recovery effort is hampered by a shortage of resources to make up for the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, World Bank President David Malpass said on Tuesday. While the Washington-based development lender has rushed out new programs to deploy $160 billion in funding to 100 countries in an effort to address the immediate emergency, the crisis will force developing nations to rethink the structure of their economies, Malpass told AFP in an interview. Initial estimates of $5 trillion in economic value destroyed by Covid-19 measures likely falls far short of the actual damage that will be done by the efforts to contain the virus, he said. The bank warned that the worldwide recession will drive 60 million people into extreme poverty but Malpass said that grim projection likely will become much worse as the crisis progresses. As he deals with the emergency, what keeps the World Bank chief up at night? \"Not enough resources,\" he said. \"I keep looking ... for others to add resources to the programs that we have up and running,\" among them direct cash payments to help the most vulnerable people in developing nations, Malpass said.

Unions said 8,000 people took part in the protest at the Maubeuge subsidiary over the cuts designed to help Renault steer out of a cash crunch exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.

In an \"adjustment\" plan announced to unions Thursday, Renault said nearly 4,600 jobs would be cut out of 48,000 in France, and more than 10,000 in the rest of the world - some eight percent of the"}

Video conferencing provider Zoom plans to strengthen encryption of video calls hosted by paying clients and institutions such as schools, but not by users of its free consumer accounts, a company official said on Friday. The company, whose business has boomed with the coronavirus pandemic, discussed the move on a call with civil liberties groups and child-sex abuse fighters on Thursday, and Zoom security consultant Alex Stamos confirmed it on Friday. In an interview, Stamos said the plan was subject to change and it was not yet clear which, if any, nonprofits or other users, such as political dissidents, might qualify for accounts allowing more secure video meetings. He added that a combination of technological, safety and business factors went into the plan, which drew mixed reactions from privacy advocates. Zoom has attracted millions of free and paying customers amid the pandemic, in part because users could join a meeting - something that now happens 300 million times a day - without registering. But that has allowed opportunities for troublemakers to slip into meetings, sometimes after pretending to be invitees. Gennie Gebhart, a researcher with the Electronic Frontier Foundation who was on Thursday\u2019s call, said she hoped Zoom would change course and offer protected video more widely. But Jon Callas, a technology fellow of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the strategy seemed a reasonable compromise.

In a workshop that blends a corporate office with a tool-packed garage, around 20 South Koreans are looking to take on the multi-billion-dollar giants of Uber, Tesla and Google parent Alphabet with a self-driving car of their own. The RideFlux start-up brings together engineers who have given up well-paid jobs with some of the South's most prestigious firms to try to build a ride-sharing company for the tech-savvy nation.

Facing its deepest recession since World War II and with business confidence collapsing, the coronavirus pandemic is hitting Italy's economy hard. Business confidence in the eurozone's third-largest economy in May plummeted to its lowest level since official statistics institute ISTAT started the index in March 2005. The figure is \"alarming\", said small business federation Confesercenti. \"The health and economic emergency has swept businesses away, especially in shops, services and tourism,\" it said.

According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), gross domestic product (GDP) at current prices amounted to 1.07 trillion Turkish liras ($176.1 billion) in the January-March period. \"Seasonally and calendar adjusted GDP increased by 0.6 percent compared with the previous quarter,\" the institute said. The figure showed that the Turkish economy was less affected by the coronavirus compared to other big economies while it came at worse than analysts\u2019 expectations. A group of 16 economists surveyed by Anadolu Agency on Wednesday had projected the Turkish economy to expand 5.2 percent in the first quarter of this year. Economists' forecasts hovered between 4.4 percent \u2014 the lowest estimate \u2014 and 5.8 percent. The economists also predicted that Turkey's annual GDP in 2020 would narrow 1.5 percent on average. Erol Gurcan, an economist at Gedik Investment, said the main driver of year-on-year growth was domestic consumption (household and public expenditures) whereas the investments and net exports handed negative contributions.

Germany and the European Commission have reached an agreement on a giant Berlin-funded rescue plan for coronavirus-hit Lufthansa, a Commission spokeswoman and a source close to the negotiations said Friday. Since the pandemic hit Europe, the Lufthansa group \u2013 which also includes Brussels and Austrian Airlines and Swiss \u2013 has been bleeding $1.1 million per hour, with around 90 percent of its 760-aircraft fleet grounded. The deal would see the German carrier give up eight planes and their associated landing rights, the spokeswoman and the source said. Lufthansa said in a statement it had \"decided to accept the commitments offered by Germany to the EU Commission\" for the rescue package, adding it would surrender up to 24 take-off and landing slots that could be allocated to rival airlines. German media had previously reported the European Commission would demand the group give up valuable takeoff and landing rights at its Frankfurt and Munich hubs in exchange for Brussels' green light. The $10 billion German state lifeline, would see Berlin take a 20-percent stake in the group, with an option to claim a further five percent plus one share to block hostile takeovers. That would make the federal government Lufthansa's biggest shareholder. On top of a total $6.3 billion in extra capital and $333 million to buy the shares at face value, public investment bank KfW would also lend Lufthansa $3.3 billion euros. The company would agree to pay back much of the capital plus interest, while granting the state two seats on its supervisory board.

US President Donald Trump is due to announce later on Friday his response to the Chinese parliament's advancement of security legislation for Hong Kong, which many lawyers, diplomats and investors fear could erode the city's freedoms. The former British colony has been wracked by civil unrest amid fears Beijing is curbing the high degree of autonomy it has enjoyed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula put in place when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 'Double-edged sword' \"Any sanctions are a double-edged sword that will not only harm the interests of Hong Kong but also significantly those of the US,\" Hong Kong's government said late on Thursday. It added that from 2009 to 2018, the US trade surplus of $297 billion with Hong Kong was the biggest among all Washington's trading partners, and 1,300 US firms were based in the city. Beijing says the new legislation - likely to take effect before September after China's parliament this week approved a decision to advance it - will tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in the city. It could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in Hong Kong. Beijing's Ministry of Public Security said it would \"guide and support\" Hong Kong police, which is supposed to be independent from China.

Zuckerberg made the comments on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"I think we've been pretty clear on what I think the right approach is - which is that I don't think that Facebook or internet platforms, in general, should be arbiters of truth.

And I think political speech is one of the most sensitive parts of a democracy,\" he told anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin in a remote interview. Zuckerberg said Facebook has a robust fact-checking program to curb the viral spread of hoaxes, and that the company would take down information that could harm users' health or suppress voter turnout. \"We had a case recently where the Brazilian president was saying that hydroxychloroquine was proven by science to be safe. And we had to make the difficult decision of taking that down,\" Zuckerberg said. \"So, there are lines, and we will enforce them. But I think in general you want to give as wide of a voice possible. And I think you want to have a special deference to political speech.\" US President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at curbing liability protections for social media companies.

The European Commission has proposed setting up a $16.6 billion fund to invest in strategic companies that have been weakened by the Covid-19 crisis. The proposal, which needs to be approved by EU governments and lawmakers, comes after firms worldwide became vulnerable to hostile takeovers as share prices fell and there were fewer funding opportunities during the coronavirus crisis. The new facility could buy stakes in, or offer loans to, strategic companies in sectors such as healthcare, space, defence, digital and green technologies, EU industry commissioner Thierry Breton told a news conference on Friday. Concerns over the vulnerability of some European companies grew in March after reports that the United States administration was looking into gaining access to Germany-based CureVac, a biotech firm working on a new technology that could slash costs for vaccines. The EU Commission reacted by promising $89.1 million to CureVac. The EU financial support would go to companies \"that need more capital to continue their expansion,\" Breton said, adding that it would also allow firms to shun help from unwanted partners. The new fund is tiny compared to large sovereign wealth funds which have hundreds of billions of dollars to invest in strategic firms. However, its financial firepower is expected to be boosted by attracting private investors with guarantees. The commission estimates that the $16.71 billion, which will be borrowed on financial markets, \"could generate investments of up to 150 billion euros\" in the 2021 to 2027 period, an EU document said. The fund is part of a wider EU plan to back companies in need of financial capital support.

But it will need much more to fight its economic woes. Something very interesting happened last year - Russia\u2019s net public debt went to zero for the first time since 2014. Basically what that meant was that Moscow had more money in its bank account than what it needed to pay its domestic and external debt. The total state debt as of August 2019 was $248 billion or 15 percent of the GDP. The amount of cash the government had in deposits was $269 billion or 16.2 percent of the GDP. Russia under President Vladimir Putin has pursued a policy of gradually cutting reliance on foriegn debt and setting aside some of its oil export revenue for a rainy day. A couple of factors are behind this cautious fiscal approach. Russia faced western sanctions and its companies were cut off from international loans after it annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine in 2014. Along with the steep drop in price of oil that started in the same year, it meant a radical rethinking of fiscal management to ward off any potential debt related problems. For Putin, foreign debt has been a touchy subject for a long time. Soon after he first took over as president in 2000, he made it a priority to reduce the country's debt burden. The financial crunch of the 1990s which wreaked economic havoc as the country struggled to pay off foreign debt has left many Russians with a bitter memory of that period. So out went the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Paris Club loans in a short period of time. Now Russia is one of the least indebted countries in the world - thanks to all the oil revenue. In the last five years, Moscow has gradually built its gross national reserves, which now exceed its external debt. Such a prudent policy is now coming in handy as Russia, along with the rest of the world, faces the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. War chest comes in"}

The French group, which is 15 percent owned by the government, had earlier this year flagged a looming \"no taboo\" plan to cut 2 billion in costs after posting its first loss in a decade last year. That raised concern for some of its factories, including in France, although closures could be politically sensitive. The French government has already said it will not sign off on a planned 5 billion euro state loan for Renault - an aid measure linked to the coronavirus pandemic - until management and unions conclude talks over the carmaker's French workforce and plants in France. The coronavirus crisis has compounded the company's problems, accentuating a slump in demand that was already hurting sales. Renault's plans to invest in and extend operations in Morocco and Romania are likely to be frozen, Les Echos newspaper reported on Thursday, while its worldwide production capacity could be cut by 4 million vehicles to 3.3 million.

{"title": "Canada to hit US aluminium with $2.7 bln counter-tariffs", "content": "The Trump administration moved to reimpose 10 percent tariffs on some Canadian aluminium products to protect US industry from a \"surge\" in imports. Ottawa will hit American aluminium products with US$2.7 billion (Can$3.6 billion) in counter-tariffs, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Friday, in response to \"absurd\" US levies announced on Canadian goods. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was reimposing a 10 percent tariff on Canadian aluminium, accusing Canada of flooding the US market with the metal. \"In imposing these tariffs, the United States has taken the absurd decision to harm its own people,\" Freeland told a news conference. Ottawa, the deputy prime minister said, will hold 30 days of consultations with Canadian industry on which US items to target with tariffs. A preliminary list published by the Canadian government includes soda and beer cans, bicycles, golf clubs and washing machines. Freeland commented that a trade war in the midst of the pandemic would be devastating to both countries, and urged the Trump administration to reconsider its move. \"A trade dispute is the last thing anyone needs,\" she said. \"It will only hurt the economic recovery on both sides of the border.\" No longer an effective alternative The US tariffs, which take effect August 16, are in response to what Washington called a 27 percent \"surge\" in aluminium imports from Canada over the past year which \"threatens to harm domestic aluminium production.\" \"I have determined that the measures agreed upon with Canada are not providing an effective alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security from imports of aluminium from Canada,\" Trump said in his proclamation. Ottawa has long rejected the national security concerns coming from a close ally, and Freeland on Friday doubled down, calling the notion \"ludicrous.\" Canada cries foul The Canadian aluminium industry, meanwhile, disputed the US data, saying shipments to the US actually fell in recent months. It noted also that the United States consumes six times more aluminium than it produces and so relies on imports. \"At a time when its economy is suffering the deepest crisis since the"}

Pakistan has set in motion a plan this week to boost the share of its electric power that comes from renewables to 30 percent by 2030, up from about 4 percent today. \u201cThe targets in the newly announced policy are a 20 percent share of renewables in installed capacity of Pakistan\u2019s power mix by 2025 and 30 percent by 2030,\u201d said Syed Aqeel Hussain Jafry, policy director for the government's Alternative Energy Development Board. That will include mainly wind and solar power, but also geothermal, tidal, wave and biomass energy, he said. With boosts in hydropower capacity expected as well, the shift could bring the share of clean energy in Pakistan's electricity mix to 65 percent by 2030, said Nadeem Babar, head of a task force on energy reforms in Pakistan. But the legislation leaves in place plans to build seven more coal-fired power plants as part of the second phase of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor project - something that could impede scale-up of renewable power, warned Zeeshan Ashfaq, a solar and wind energy developer in Pakistan. \"A coal pipeline of around 4,000-5,000 megawatts will not provide much space for renewables,\" said Ashfaq, managing director of SOWITEC (Solar Wind Technology) Pakistan. The new national renewables policy, approved by the prime minister's cabinet last December, was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic and as negotiators tried to resolve disputes with individual provinces. But Asad Umar, federal minister for planning and development, said on social media the resolution of those disputes now opened the way to \"unleash Pakistan's full potential\" for renewables.

His comments in a letter to ByteDance's Chinese employees on Tuesday came after the company and Zhang were heavily criticised on Chinese social media for entering into talks with Microsoft Corp to sell TikTok's US operations.

French prosecutors have indicted pharma giant Sanofi for manslaughter over birth defects linked to an epilepsy drug in a long-running case that has also seen the company charged with fraud. The charges relate to the drug valproate, marketed as Depakine among other trade names, which studies say has caused disabilities in about 15,000 to 30,000 children whose mothers took the medicine while pregnant. The research found that when pregnant women took the drug, their children had an elevated risk, between 10 to 40 percent, of congenital malformations, autism and learning difficulties. Sanofi is facing separate charges of aggravated fraud and unintentionally causing injury in 42 cases filed by families, but insists it had warned health authorities of the drug's risks already in the 1980s. Manslaughter charges On Monday, the company confirmed a report in Le Monde newspaper that prosecutors have now also charged it with manslaughter. But in a statement sent to AFP, it insisted it had \"fulfilled its obligation\" of providing information on the drug and its side-effects, and said it \"contests the validity of these proceedings.\" Sanofi said it has filed a legal challenge to the indictment. Under the French legal system, charges do not automatically result in a trial as prosecutors can decide not to proceed based on a lack of evidence. Known side-effects Last month, a French court ordered the state to pay thousands of euros in damages over the scandal, saying officials should have ensured the drug was not taken by pregnant women. The court found that health officials knew about the risk of birth defects from Depakine already in 1983, and of learning disabilities and autism from 2004. Another 500 complaints have been lodged with France's national compensation agency for medical accidents, which has already proposed a $7.6 million (6.5-million-euro) package for Depakine victims.

Reels lets users record videos of up to 15 seconds and provides tools for editing, audio and effects, according to the Facebook-owned company. Trump has threatened to ban China-based TikTok in the United States on national security grounds, giving it until the middle of September to work out a takeover deal with Microsoft or another suitor.

With growing pressure to keep China's Huawei out of 5G network development, it could be time for firms like Japan's NEC and South Korea's Samsung to shine. Washington has pushed allies to bar Huawei, a Chinese telecom giant, from building next-generation 5G mobile networks, claiming its equipment can be used to spy for Beijing. Huawei denies the charges, but US pressure has prompted an about-turn in Britain. The government had already pledged to cut the firm out of the most sensitive \"core\" elements of 5G that access personal data, and is now reportedly pushing for plans to end Huawei's involvement in Britain's 5G infrastructure by 2023. But excluding Huawei is not without challenges, because there are currently only two alternatives in Europe for 5G equipment such as antennas and relay masts: Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson. Britain has encouraged Washington to form a club of 10 democratic nations that could develop its own 5G technology, but there has been little movement so far. \"The vast majority of the commercial networks sold in the world come from the big three,\" said Sylvain Chevallier, in charge of telecoms at BearingPoint consultancy, referring to Huawei, Nokia and Ericsson. \"But a world of three is not good for operators, and if it goes down to two it will be worse still,\" he told AFP.

Google is paying $450 million for a nearly 7 percent stake in longtime home and business security provider ADT Inc. in a deal that will open new opportunities for one of the internet's most powerful companies to extend the reach of its Nest cameras and voice-activated voice assistant. As part of the partnership announced on Monday, ADT will use Nest's internet-connected cameras, as well as another device called the Nest Home Hub that comes with an internet-connected camera, as part of its customers' security systems. Both the Nest cameras and Home Hub can be operated through voice commands processed by the Google digital assistant that competes against Amazon's Alexa and Amazon's Siri in a key area of artificial intelligence. The alliance could serve as a springboard for a home management product line that Google has been developing since shelling out $3.2 billion in 2014 to buy Nest, a startup launched by Tony Fadell, who played an instrumental role in creating the iPhone while he was at Apple.

Washington and Ankara have endured several rough patches while navigating the alliance they have today. The history of their rocky relationship goes back to the 1950s when Turkey joined NATO and became its indispensable partner with the second biggest army against Russia-led communist bloc. Since then, both countries have developed strong connections in various fields - from industry to the military, and to other economic aspects. Most recently, Lindsey Graham, a powerful Republican senator, who reportedly wields a strong influence over US President Donald Trump, has suggested that relations between Washington and Ankara could be taken to the next level if the two allies were to sign a free trade agreement. \"If you ask me what the one thing the United States and Turkey could do to change the relationship for the better, it would be a free trade agreement -- not just aspiring to have more trade to hit $100 billion, but actually integrate the economies through a free trade agreement,\" said Graham on Wednesday during a conference organised by the US-Turkey Business Council.

The Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents more than 50 airports, said future passenger numbers at UK airports were expected to be significantly lower, and analysis of its members suggested up to 20,000 jobs were at risk. The government should scrap its quarantine regime, provide relief from business rates, extend a job retention scheme, directly fund the sector regulator and suspend air passenger taxes to help save jobs, the AOA said in statement on Wednesday. \"These jobs figures clearly show that a key component of the UK\u2019s infrastructure is on its knees, with no relief to the current crisis expected,\" said AOA chief executive Karen Dee. \"Government needs to recognise the immense crisis facing the country\u2019s airport communities and take action to support UK aviation and protect livelihoods.\" READ MORE: International tourism to fall as much as 80 percent due to virus \u2013 UN Major airlines cut jobs UK-based airlines British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and easyJet have already announced close to 20,000 job losses between them. The country's biggest airport Heathrow has also started a voluntary redundancy scheme. Britain has a 14-day quarantine policy in place for arrivals into the country from abroad, which airlines, airports and the hospitality sector have said is deterring international travel at a time when they had been hoping for it to recover. The rule is due to be reviewed on June 29, three weeks after it was introduced and could be replaced by \"air bridges,\" which would allow restriction-free travel between countries with low infection rates.

Unilever Plc said on Monday it will invest $1.1 billion in a fund to invest in climate change projects and reduce to net zero greenhouse gas emissions from all its products by 2039, 11 years ahead of the Paris Agreement deadline. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company whose brands include Dove soap and Knorr soup, said it was responding to the \"scale and urgency\" of the climate change crisis. The fund will invest in projects including reforestation, water preservation and carbon sequestration over the next ten years, it said. The net zero emission target is an extension of efforts already underway to cut emissions within the company by 2030 - such as reducing electricity consumption within offices. Unilever's total greenhouse gas footprint was around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2019 according to its website. \"We are now going much wider in our commitments, we call it a cradle to shelf commitment...across the value chain,\" Unilever Chief Supply Chain Officer, Marc Engel said. Unilever, which has an annual turnover of $58.5 billion, said it would prioritise partnerships with suppliers who have set emission reduction targets and has set up a system where suppliers must declare the carbon footprint of goods and services provided. All packaging from 2039 will show the carbon footprint of the product, the company said. Companies promise net zero emissions from supply chain Unilever joins a handful of companies in promising net zero emissions from their supply chain. Kit-Kat maker Nestle and German elevator maker Thyssenkrupp AG are others though their targets are set for 2050, which is the deadline set by the Paris Agreement on climate change to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0 degrees.

The workers in a petition seen by Reuters expressed disappointment with Google not joining the \"millions who want to defang and defund\" police departments. Civil rights activists across the United States for years have called for scaling back traditional policing, and the efforts have gained momentum through protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody last month. \"We should not be in the business of profiting from racist policing,\" the Google petition said. It cited sales of the company's G Suite package, which includes tools for email, document editing and file storage, to the police department in Clarkstown, New York.

Google has faced internal criticism in the past over sales and partnerships involving the US military, as well as foreign governments seen by human rights activists as authoritarian. While the company has pulled back from some deals like facial recognition, it has responded to concerns by saying it remains committed to helping governments with cybersecurity and other issues. \"We're committed to work that makes a meaningful difference to combat systemic racism, and our employees have made over 500 product suggestions in recent weeks, which we are reviewing,\" the spokesperson added.

The Venezuelan political deadlock between President Nicholas Maduro and Juan Guadio, the opposition leader and the president of the country\u2019s Congress, has manifested itself in various forms in recent years. Most recently, the two powerful political figures have begun to fight over $1bn of their country\u2019s 14 tonnes of gold that is deposited with the Bank of England in London for safekeeping. They are each suggesting they have the legitimate political mandate to use the deposits. Since the latest presidential elections in 2018, Maduro\u2019s government and his presidency have been challenged by Guaido, who declared himself as interim president claiming the elections were fraudulent. But the military, and a crucial part of Venezuelan society, stands for Maduro, a situation that ultimately prevents Guaido from ousting Maduro. Citing the political uncertainty and the problem with authority in Venezuela, the Bank of England (BoE) has refused to release the bullion to the Maduro government, leading the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV) - controlled by the president - to apply to the High Court in London to elicit an order to get the gold out. The court is expected to rule in the next three days.

Gold production in Democratic Republic of Congo continues to be systematically underreported while tonnes of the precious metal is smuggled into global supply chains through its eastern neighbours, a United Nations report has found. The countries along Congo's eastern border have long been conduits for gold worth billions of dollars mined using rudimentary means by so-called \"artisanal\" miners. Difficult to trace, trade in the precious metal has fueled regional wars, funded rebel fighters and led to UN sanctions on traders involved in a bid to staunch the flow. North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri provinces reported official production of just over 60 kilograms of artisanal gold in 2019, yet exported a total of just over 73 kilograms, the UN Group of Experts on the Congo found in its annual report. The group estimated that at least 1.1 tonnes of gold were smuggled out of Ituri province alone in 2019. That would have earned the government up to $1.88 million in taxes had it been legally exported. Across all gold-producing provinces the loss is likely much greater. Artisanal miners in Congo produce 15 to 22 tonnes of gold a year, Germany's Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources has estimated. \"The country remained one of the Great Lakes region's largest artisanal gold producers, and yet one of its smallest official exporters,\" the Group of Experts wrote. Asked by Reuters about the report, Congo's mines minister, Willy Kitobo Samsoni, said he could not immediately share his figures on mineral smuggling from the east of the country. The UN experts also found that Uganda and other neighbouring countries export far more gold than they produce, suggesting they might still be staging posts for smuggled Congolese gold. More than 95 percent of gold exports from Uganda in 2019, which totalled just over 25 tonnes, were not of Ugandan origin, the group estimated, based on 2018 production and 2019 export data.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that California is examining the retail giant's business practices, focusing partly on how Amazon treats independent sellers on its platform. Also on Friday, The New York Times reported that state investigators in Washington are reviewing Amazon's handling of third-party sellers on its site.

An irony of the coronavirus pandemic is that the idyllic beach vacation in Mexico in the brochures really does exist now: The white sand beaches are sparkling clean and empty on the Caribbean coast, the water is clear on the Pacific coast and the waters around the resort of Los Cabos are teeming with fish after 10 weeks with no boats going out. There are two-for-one deals and very eager staff. It\u2019s all only an airline flight, and a taxi ride, and a reception desk away, and that\u2019s the problem. Vacation during an outbreak There are a number of ways to think about it: Might it be safer to travel than stay home? How much is mental health worth, and, if people are going to socially distance anyway, why not do it in a beautiful, isolated place? On the other hand, despite the pandemic, flights are often crowded, even hotels in Mexico that bend over backwards to disinfect everything have little capacity to actually test their employees, and while fellow guests are likely to be few and far between, they also probably won't be wearing masks. It was all on display as the first excited tourists arrived at the Moon Palace beach resort near Cancun last week, to the sound of mariachis and welcoming employees lined up, at a safe distance, to greet them. \u201cThe customers all took off their masks as soon as they came into the hotel,\u201d said Gibran Chapur, vice president of Palace Resorts. \u201cYou can't be all covered up when you are on vacation, thinking you have to be in reclusion.

Microsoft has become the third big tech company this week to say it won\u2019t sell its facial recognition software to police, following similar moves by Amazon and IBM. Microsoft's president and chief counsel, Brad Smith, announced the decision and called on Congress to regulate the technology during a Washington Post video event on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided we will not sell facial recognition technology to police departments in the United States until we have a national law in place, grounded in human rights, that will govern this technology,\u201d Smith said. The trio of tech giants is stepping back from law-enforcement use of systems that have faced criticism for incorrectly identifying people with darker skin. Ongoing protests following the death of George Floyd have focused attention on racial injustice in the US and how police use technology to track people. But while all three companies are known for their work in developing artificial intelligence, including face recognition software, none is a major player in selling such technology to police. Smith said Thursday that Microsoft currently doesn't sell its face recognition software to any U.S. police departments.

Following the broad strokes of a scheme dangled last week, the economy ministry and Lufthansa said Monday the German government would offer a $3.27 billion loan and $6.2 billion of \"silent\" capital, as well as buying 20 percent of the company for $327 million. If Lufthansa faces a hostile takeover, \"the economic stabilisation fund (WSF) may also increase its stake to 25 percent plus one share,\" the company said, which would offer Berlin a blocking minority. The final deal reflects concerns within the group and among conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government about excessive, enduring government influence over the former flag carrier. Lufthansa will commit to repay the state's \"silent\" capital injection, plus interest, in exchange for the WSF selling its stake on the market by December 31 2023. \"Before the coronavirus pandemic, the company was operatively healthy and profitable and had good prospects for the future,\" the economy ministry said in a statement justifying the massive support.

Its operating regions including Europe, Australia and New Zealand are not included in the US proceedings. The more than a century old car rental firm Hertz Global Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday after its business was decimated during the coronavirus pandemic and talks with creditors failed to result in much-needed relief. Hertz's board earlier in the day approved the company seeking Chapter 11 protection in a US bankruptcy court in Delaware, according to court records. Its international operating regions including Europe, Australia and New Zealand were not included in the US proceedings, the company said. The firm, whose largest shareholder is billionaire investor Carl Icahn with a nearly 39 percent ownership stake, is reeling from government orders restricting travel and requiring citizens to remain home. A large portion of Hertz's revenue comes from car rentals at airports, which have all but evaporated as potential customers eschew plane travel. With nearly $19 billion of debt and roughly 38,000 employees worldwide as of the end of 2019, Hertz is among the largest companies to be undone by the pandemic. The public health crisis has also caused a cascade of bankruptcies or Chapter 11 preparations among companies dependent on consumer demand, including retailers, restaurants and oil and gas firms. US airlines have so far avoided similar fates after receiving billions of dollars in government aid, an avenue Hertz has explored without success. The Estero, Florida-based company, which operates Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty car-rentals, had been in talks with creditors after skipping significant car-lease payments due in April. Forbearance and waiver agreements on the missed payments were set to expire on May 22. Hertz has about $1 billion of cash. The size of Hertz's lease obligations have increased as the value of vehicles declined because of the pandemic.

EU member states Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands stated their opposition on Saturday to a French-German plan for a $545 billion coronavirus recovery fund that would issue grants, calling for a loans-based approach instead. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel made the surprise proposal on Monday to set up a fund that would offer grants to European Union regions and sectors hit hardest by the pandemic. The idea of grants, however, is anathema to the EU's self-styled \"frugal four\", who generally oppose big spending and fear the proposal will lead to a mutualisation of member states' debt. \"We propose to create an Emergency Recovery Fund based on a 'loans for loans' approach,\" the four countries said in a so-called \"non-paper\" outlining their position to other member states and released by Austria.

Paris and Berlin, whose agreements often pave the way for broader EU deals, proposed that the European Commission borrow the money on behalf of the whole EU and spend it as an additional top-up to the 2021-2027 EU budget that is already close to $1.1 trillion. The European Commission is to present its own proposal for a recovery fund linked to the EU's next long-term budget on May 27 and said it welcomed the initiative from France and Germany.

Lebanon's central bank will begin injecting dollars into the market beginning on Monday in order to strengthen the Lebanese pound, President Michel Aoun said on Friday, following a rapid fall in the currency in recent days. Speaking at the start of a cabinet session, Aoun said huge losses to the financial system should not be borne by depositors but instead by the government, central bank and commercial banks. Earlier, Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri said the government was working on steps to strengthen the country's collapsing pound currency, with an aim of reducing its price against the dollar to 3,000-3,200 pounds. The pound has seen its value fall quickly in recent days, slipping to about 5,000 to the dollar on Thursday from about 4,100 a week earlier, sparking protests across the country. The pound has lost some 70 percent of its value since October, when protests first erupted and the country plunged into a financial crisis that has seen dollars dry up and the economy grind to a halt. Despite renewed government push to strengthen the currency, more protests are expected in Lebanon, journalist Imogen Kimber told TRT World . \"There's absolutely no certainty... people here are in a desperate situation.

For automakers Renault and Nissan, the world is currently a very different place to what it had been just a few short months ago. In 2017 and 2018, the Franco-Japanese industrial alliance had ranked the world's biggest automaker with sales of 10.6 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. But by the end of 2019, if the wheels have not quite come off, the two have nevertheless had a bumpy ride, after the man who oversaw that achievement, Carlos Ghosn, fled a trial in Japan over allegations of financial misconduct, and surfaced in Lebanon. Digesting that scandal was one thing. Coping with the economic mayhem wrought by the coronavirus pandemic was a task of a completely different dimension. Ghosn's expansion strategy of the past now appears to hail from a galaxy millions of light years away. Today, the alliance is looking to cut back production capacity in view of the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic as the two carmakers \u2013 which had previously accounted for some 10 percent of the global auto market \u2013 realign themselves to the new reality.

US authorities on Wednesday arrested a former Green Beret and his son who are accused of helping former Nissan Motor Co chairman Carlos Ghosn flee Japan while he awaited trial on financial misconduct charges. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas said Michael Taylor, 59, and Peter Taylor, 27, were arrested by the US Marshals Service in Harvard, Massachusetts. The two Americans are wanted by Japan officials on charges that they helped Ghosn escape the country in December after the former Nissan boss was released on bail. Ghosn said he fled because he could not expect a fair trial, was subjected to unfair conditions in detention and was barred from meeting his wife under his bail conditions. Ghosn has said he is innocent of allegations he under-reported his future income and committed a breach of trust by diverting Nissan money for his personal gain. He says the compensation was never decided on or received, and that the Nissan payments were for legitimate business purposes. Michael Taylor flew into Japan on a private jet from the United Arab Emirates with another man, George-Antoine Zayek, and they brought two large black boxes with them and claimed to be musicians carrying audio equipment, according to court papers. They helped Ghosn escape to the airport by hiding him in one of the boxes, the documents say. Japanese officials had also issued a provisional warrant for Zayek\u2019s arrest. The men arrived at Japan's Kansai International Airport with luggage that included the two large boxes, and Ghosn was inside one of them, court papers said. The luggage passed through a security checkpoint without being checked and was loaded onto a private jet headed for Turkey, the documents say. Two days later, Ghosn announced publicly he was in Lebanon.

While Mickey Mouse joined familiar Disney characters welcoming the crowds, the Shanghai experience will not be as it was: Instead of parades and fireworks, there are mandatory masks, temperature screenings and social distancing for visitors and employees. Among the crowd on Monday was Shanghai Disneyland passholder Kay Yu. \"I think (these measures) make tourists feel at ease,\" said the 29-year-old, who was wearing a Minnie Mouse hat and said he had woken up at 4 am to make the trip to the park. Disney's $5.5 billion China flagship is the first of its six resorts around the world to reopen after the pandemic that has now killed more than 280,000 people globally threw consumer service businesses around the world into turmoil. The reopening may provide a glimpse of how Disney can begin to recover from closures set to strip $1.4 billion from the company's profit. But the limited scope of the reopening in Shanghai underlines the scale of that task: While it welcomed more than 10 million guests in its first year after opening in 2016, the park will now restrict visitor numbers to 20 percent of daily capacity, or about 16,000 people - far below a level initially requested by the Chinese government. As well as scrapping parades and fireworks - replacing the latter with an evening light projection show - Disney has shut interactive children's play areas and indoor live theatre shows.

Analysts say the move points to China missing its key political goal of doubling gross domestic product from 2010 levels, a blow to the ruling party's pledge to provide prosperity in exchange for unquestioned political power. The government usually sets economic growth targets that it regularly exceeds. But this year, given \"great uncertainty\" caused by the pandemic, Beijing will not set a target but \"give priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards\", Premier Li Keqiang told the opening of the National People's Congress. Before the pandemic, Beijing was widely expected to announce a growth target of around six percent this year. But with the Covid-19 shock causing economic growth to shrink 6.8 percent in the first quarter, such a target was seen as no longer feasible.

The figure, set at $178.16 billion (1.268 trillion yuan), is closely watched as a barometer of how aggressively the country will beef up its military capabilities. China set a 7.5 percent rise for the defence budget in 2019, outpacing what ended up as full-year GDP growth of 6.1 percent in the world's second-largest economy.

The deadly pandemic has laid bare the deficiencies of the modern nation-state model and its governments. This has been particularly stark in the most developed economies like the US, the UK and France. The poor care of the elderly population \u2014 the segment most vulnerable to the threat presented by the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 in nursing homes across several countries has become a shocking reality, eroding citizens\u2019 trust in their governments. \u201cWe think, \u2018these people are going to die anyway\u2019,\u201d said Charlene Harrington, a professor at the nursing school at University of California, San Francisco, speaking of the elephant in the room. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), nursing home deaths in Europe account for half of the countries\u2019 total deaths linked to the virus as New York reports nearly 5,000 deaths in their long-term-care facilities. Total deaths in the American financial capital currently hover around 20,000, leading all other states as the US tops all other countries with a staggering 74,000 deaths. In the UK, according to some researchers, nursing home deaths could be 40 percent of the total fatalities while those facilities are home to less than 1 percent of the country\u2019s population. In Spain, where a fiasco regarding nursing homes emerged at the beginning of the pandemic in March, nursing homes deaths stand at 16,000 more than half of the country\u2019s nearly 26,000 fatalities. But experts doubt the accuracy of the reported fatalities regarding nursing homes across Europe and the US as many older citizens have been found dead in their beds in Spanish care facilities and makeshift morgues in New Jersey. Nursing home model Professor Harrington thinks that the way the nursing home business has been conducted in the US and some other places has facilitated \u201ca disaster in the making.\u201d \u201cNursing homes are the weak link in our healthcare system, and we\u2019ve allowed it,\u201d the professor told the Financial Times.

Tesla Inc's chief executive Elon Musk tweeted on Saturday that Tesla will move its headquarters and future programs to Texas or Nevada from California immediately. \"If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen (sp) on how Tesla is treated in the future,\" he wrote on Twitter, referring to the facility in the San Francisco Bay area that is Tesla's only US vehicle factory. Musk also tweeted about suing Alameda County, California, after its health department said the electric carmaker must not reopen the Fremont factory as local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect. Alameda County said on Saturday that it has been working with Tesla to develop a safety plan that \"allows for reopening while protecting the health and well-being of the thousands of employees\" that work at the factory and that it looks forward to coming to an agreement on a safety plan very soon. Musk had told employees on Thursday that limited production would restart at Fremont on Friday afternoon. Tesla builds more than 415,000 cars per year at the Fremont plant and moving the entire production facility would be a massive undertaking. Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, on Saturday estimated it could take the company 12 to 18 months to relocate production. The threat to relocate the facility also comes as Tesla aims to ramp up production at Fremont of its Model Y sport utility vehicle, the carmaker's most profitable vehicle to date. California Governor Gavin Newsom had said on Thursday that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen.

Lebanese must set aside their differences as the country has no time to lose in tackling its major financial crisis, Prime Minister Hassan Diab warned on Wednesday, saying a government recovery plan was not a sacred text and could be amended. The government approved the plan last week, announcing that it would form the basis of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for aid. Diab was speaking at a meeting of Lebanon's fractious sectarian leadership to review the plan, which maps out vast losses in the financial system. President Michel Aoun said the IMF was a \"mandatory path\" for recovery. The government proposals have encountered strong criticism from the commercial banking sector which, according to the plan, is set to sustain losses of some $83.2 billion. \"Time is very precious. The accumulated losses are very big. The situation is very painful, and the chance to rectify (the situation) will not last long,\" Diab told the meeting convened at the presidential palace. He urged political parties, economic syndicates and the banks to set aside differences. There was no place for score-settling, he said, adding that trading accusations would be \"costly for all\". Diab's government was appointed in January with backing from the powerful, Iran-backed Shia group Hezbollah and its allies including the Christian Maronite head of state, President Michel Aoun. Leading Sunni politician Saad Hariri, a former prime minister and traditional ally of Gulf Arab and Western states, did not attend the meeting. Neither did Druze leader Walid Jumblatt though Aoun's Maronite rival, Samir Geagea, attended. The crisis is seen as the greatest risk to stability since the 1975-90 civil war.

The independent board, which some have dubbed Facebook's \"Supreme Court,\" will be able to overturn decisions by the company and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on whether individual pieces of content should be allowed on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook has long faced criticism for high-profile content moderation issues. They range from temporarily removing a famous Vietnam-era war photo of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack, to failing to combat hate speech in Myanmar against the Rohingya and other Muslims. Content issues The oversight board will focus on a small slice of challenging content issues including hate speech and harassment and people's safety. Facebook said the board's members have lived in 27 countries and speak at least 29 languages, though a quarter of the group and two of the four co-chairs are from the United States, where the company is headquartered. The co-chairs, who selected the other members jointly with Facebook, are former US federal circuit judge and religious freedom expert Michael McConnell, constitutional law expert Jamal Greene, Colombian attorney Catalina Botero-Marino and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt.

The number of international tourist arrivals could plunge by 60 to 80 percent in 2020 owing to the coronavirus, the World Tourism Organization said on Thursday, revising its previous forecast sharply lower. Widespread travel restrictions and the closure of airports and national borders to curb the spread of the virus had plunged international tourism into its worst crisis since records began in 1950, the UN body said in a statement. Tourist arrivals fell by 22 percent in the first three months of the year and by 57 percent in March alone, with Asia and Europe suffering the biggest declines, according to the Madrid-based organisation. \"The world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis. Tourism has been hit hard, with millions of jobs at risk in one of the most labour-intensive sectors of the economy,\" said the body's secretary-general, Zurab Pololikashvili. Airlines have suffered the most since the outbreak began with most flights grounded, but hotel groups, cruise operators and tour operators are also reeling. The UN body said the full extent of the fall in international tourism would depend on how quickly international borders open again. Under a best-case scenario, with travel restrictions starting to ease in early July, international tourist arrivals could fall by just 58 percent. If borders and travel restrictions are only lifted in early December, the fall would be more in the order of 78 percent. If the restrictions are lifted in early September, the UN body predicts a fall of 70 percent. Under these scenarios, the drop in international travel could lead to a loss of $910 billion to $1.2 trillion in export revenues from tourism, and of 100 to 120 million direct tourism jobs. While international tourism has taken a hit from the outbreak of disease in the past, the new coronavirus is unprecedented in its geographic spread.

US tech giants such as Facebook and Amazon could face tougher rules as European Union regulators seek evidence to curb their role as gatekeepers to the internet and access to people, information and services, according to an EU tender seen by Reuters. The outcome could force Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to separate their competing businesses, provide rivals access to their data and open up their standards to them. The European Commission, which in February said it was considering legislation against large online platforms acting as gatekeepers, has put out a 600,000-euro ($649,800) tender for a study to gather evidence of such gatekeeping power. The study should look into self-preferencing practices and the possibility of forcing dominant companies to separate their businesses, the tender said, citing Amazon which is both a retailer and a market place operator, and app developer and App Store operator Apple. \"A general, automatic rule could prohibit or restrict any differentiated treatment by those platforms when they are vertically integrated, to separate clearly their roles as organisers of the marketplace and as a competitor on these marketplaces,\" the tender document read. Tech giants with vast troves of data and unwilling to share them with smaller rivals may be required by regulatory measures to offer access on reasonable, standardised and non-discriminatory terms, the document said. The study should also focus on tech companies' use of data from one market to expand into other markets, making it difficult for current or new rivals to compete, the paper said, citing the example of Facebook and its Whatsapp unit. Another area of interest is information asymmetries characterised by social media platforms and search engines amassing vast amounts of data via free services, resulting in users reluctant to switch to a competing company.

The figure for the week ended July 4 was 99,000 lower than the prior week, showing a steady decline as the world's largest economy gradually reopens and workers are recalled to their jobs. But the level remains far higher than any pre-pandemic week. In the same week of 2019, only 211,000 people filed initial claims for jobless benefits.

The crisis has led to a confrontation between the country\u2019s financial elites and the new technocratic government. One of the country\u2019s top and most powerful bankers, Riad Salame, who has been one of the longest-serving central bank governors across the globe, and Hassan Diab, a computer engineering professor, who is now in the office of the prime ministry, are clashing with each other openly, evoking memories of Lebanon\u2019s bloody history of civil war. \u201cApparently, there is a war between the financial sector and the government in Lebanon. The central bank governor appears to be the official representative of the financial sector in a country, where too many banks function compared to the population,\u201d says Gokhan Ovenc, an assistant professor of economics at the Istanbul University. In March, the Diabi government defaulted on $90 billion of debt, signalling growing problems and divisions between the government - which wanted to default - and the central bank, which advocated to continue paying debts. Last month, the International Monetary Organisation (IMF) announced that Salame\u2019s central bank lost nearly $49billion , which is equal to more than 90 percent of the country\u2019s total economic production in 2019 according to World Bank numbers.

Like YouTube, it's known for \u201cuser-generated\u201d content rather than the big-budget, professional movies and TV shows Disney is famous for. Having a US-based CEO from a major American media company could help TikTok navigate the US regulatory environment and approach to privacy and data security, said eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson. \u201cHaving someone who's familiar with that at the helm is certain to be helpful for them,\u201d she said. TikTok has been the focus of US national-security concerns because of its Chinese ownership. A US national-security agency is reviewing ByteDance\u2019s purchase of TikTok's precursor, Musical.ly, while the US military branches have banned the app from government-issued phones. The US in recent years has cracked down on Chinese companies, including telecom giant Huawei, under the pretext that Chinese companies may share data with the Chinese government. TikTok and Huawei deny such allegations. The federal government has also fined TikTok for breaking children's privacy laws, and privacy watchdogs recently filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission saying the company was still violating the law. Mayer, whose new job includes a top role at TikTok's parent company ByteDance, could also help popularize ByteDance's other apps globally, Williamson said."}

France, which has long been sceptical of the growing power of US tech titans, is seeking to bypass Apple and Google for a smartphone app to help trace people infected with the novel coronavirus. The move, which leaves France relatively isolated in Europe alongside Britain and Norway, reflects differences on how such apps should be structured, who has access to sensitive data and their effectiveness. A number of countries have already deployed \"contact tracing\" apps on smartphones that track a person's contacts and alert them if need be, generating vital information to help contain outbreaks and slow the spread of the virus as nations ease lockdowns and get back to work. These apps can be based either on a decentralised or centralised architecture. A decentralised architecture keeps the information about whom a person has been in contact with on the smartphone. If the person declares themselves to have been infected by the coronavirus, then those people deemed to have been in close contact for an extended period receive a notification to isolate themselves and get tested. In a centralised system the data is managed by an authority, say a national health service, that would have access to the data to ensure those who are exposed are indeed following the proper health and isolation recommendations. Apple and Google banded together last month to develop coronavirus contact tracing technology that would work across their operating systems. The technology, set to be released later this month, embraces a decentralised architecture that would enable smartphone users to control their own data, and choose whether to notify the authorities if they have been exposed. Titans setting the terms Numerous tech experts and privacy advocates prefer a decentralised option because of data privacy concerns, worried about governments establishing databases that could be used for surveillance, even after the pandemic. But France, along with London, contest that argument and prefer a centralised architecture that will provide them"}

China added to tensions with Australia on Monday by announcing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties totalling 80.5 percent on Australian barley imports from May 19, which is expected to all but halt a billion-dollar trade between them. China's Ministry of Commerce said it had confirmed dumping by Australia and significant damage on its domestic industry as a result, following an inquiry which began in 2018. The tariffs on barley, which will remain in place for five years, are the latest agricultural commodity to be affected by a deteriorating relationship between Canberra and Beijing. The Chinese ministry said duties of 73.6 percent would be levied on all companies, including four named exporters, The Iluka Trust, Kalgan Nominees Pty. Ltd, JW&JI Mcdonald & Sons and Haycroft Enterprises, as well as an anti-subsidy duty of 6.9 percent. 'It's very replaceable' Australia is the biggest barley supplier to China, exporting about $980 million to $1.3 billion worth a year, which is more than half its exports. Barley is used both for brewing and animal feed. \"There aren't many alternative markets. It could be sold to Saudi Arabia, but it will be heavily discounted to what Australian farmers could have received by selling to China,\" an Australian government source told Reuters news agency. By contrast, China - the world's top barley importer - will simply shift purchasing to other key producers, including France, Canada, Argentina and some smaller European exporters. \"It's very replaceable,\" said Andries De Groen, managing director at Germany headquartered barley trader Evergrain. Australia disappointed Australia's Minister for Trade Simon Birmingham said the Chinese decision was deeply disappointing. \"We reject the basis of this decision and will be assessing the details of the findings while we consider the next steps,\" Birmingham said in an emailed statement. \"We reserve the right to appeal this matter further.\" Australia's relationship with Beijing soured in 2018 when it banned Huawei from its nascent 5G broadband network, while tensions were escalated by concerns within Canberra"}

It was the highest level since July 1996, when Britain's economy was still recovering from a deep recession caused by its failed bid to stay in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, which had pushed interest rates to 15 percent in 1992.

Facebook Inc is launching Shops, a service that will allow businesses to display and sell products on the world's largest social network's platforms, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Tuesday. The move to build up e-commerce offerings follows Facebook's launch last year of limited shopping options on photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp. Company leaders wager making the platforms more business-friendly will generate fresh ad revenue, even as user growth slows. Facebook Shops will tie at least some of those efforts together, enabling businesses to set up a single online store accessible via both Facebook and Instagram. A checkout feature will enable in-app purchases, while a more deeply integrated messaging feature will allow customers to chat with businesses through WhatsApp, Messenger or Instagram Direct. Zuckerberg also said the world's largest social network would be working more closely on product integrations with Shopify and seven other online commerce platforms going forward. He had Shopify CEO Tobias L\u00fctke join him in a livestreamed video announcing the partnerships. Shopify's shares sank after the initial Facebook Shops launch, then rebounded following L\u00fctke's appearance. Shares of both companies were up over 2% in afternoon US trade. As with Facebook's other e-commerce features, Shops will be free for businesses to access with the expectation it will boost consumer engagement and ad sales. \"Our business model here is ads,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Rather than charge businesses for Shops, we know that Shops are valuable for businesses. They're going to in general bid more for ads and we'll eventually make money that way.\" Facebook is also rolling out a tool to connect loyalty programs and a shopping feature showing product tags underneath live videos, allowing viewers to make purchases while watching.

Huawei on Monday assailed the latest US move to cut it off from semiconductor suppliers as a \"pernicious\" attack that will put the Chinese technology giant in \"survival\" mode and sow chaos in the global technology sector. \"The decision was arbitrary and pernicious and threatens to undermine the entire (technology) industry worldwide,\" Huawei said in a statement. Huawei has largely weathered an escalating 18-month campaign by the Trump administration to isolate it internationally.

But the Huawei statement said the US decision \"will have a serious impact on a wide number of global industries\" by creating uncertainty in the chip sector and technology supply chains. US officials said Huawei had been circumventing sanctions by obtaining chips and components that are produced around the world based on American technology. Washington last year said it would blacklist Huawei from the US market and from buying crucial American components, though it has extended a series of reprieves to allow US businesses that work with Huawei time to adjust. On Friday it extended this reprieve by another 90 days but said these exceptions are not likely to be extended further.

The suit, filed at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s offices in the Netherlands, was the first of its kind to target a multinational company, the plaintiffs said. \"McDonald's workers have sounded the alarm about sexual harassment and gender-based violence for years, but a company with a culture rotten from the top has failed to take meaningful action to address the problem,\" said Sue Longley, general secretary of the International Union of Foodworkers, in a statement. \"Because McDonald's has neglected to act to create a safe workplace, the Dutch government should make use of this complaint to empower workers to effectively address the rampant harassment they face under the Golden Arches,\" she said.

But many things have changed since 1997, when the former British colony became an integral part of China. It has faced pressure campaigns directed by Beijing on several occasions, events that have disrupted life and seen its citizens compelled to take to the streets to protest. This year's demonstrations have increasingly proved an undeviating challenge to Beijing's hegemony. The city received an unexpected setback on Wednesday. The hawkish US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, announced that Hong Kong will not be entitled to 'special treatment' from Washington anymore, citing the loss of its autonomous status and China's expanding stranglehold on the region. \u201cI certified to Congress today that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws in the same manner as US laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997,\u201d Pompeo said.

It is estimated that global CO2 emissions will go down by 8 percent or 2.8 gigatons - the largest drop ever recorded - as people stay indoors and burn fewer fossil fuels. But there is another side to the story. There are concerns about oil and gas, both having taken a hammering from the coronavirus pandemic as lockdowns everywhere have dampened economic activity and energy consumption. According to the latest report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), countries are experiencing between 25 percent and 18 percent decline in energy demand, dependent on the severity of individual lockdowns. Of the fossil fuels, oil has taken the biggest hit as a result of quarantines forcing cars off the roads and air travel being largely grounded. \u201cAt the height of the lockdowns in April, when more than 4 billion people worldwide were subject to some form of confinement, year-on-year demand for oil was down by around 25 mb/d (million barrels per day),\u201d the report says.

If HBO Max does not resume production by this fall, the service could start to see a shortage of original content as early as January, according to a source familiar with the company. At $15 per month, the service is more expensive than both the $7 per month Disney+ streaming service and the $13 per month standard Netflix plan. Still, WarnerMedia hopes to reach about 80 million global HBO Max subscribers by 2025. Many existing HBO subscribers in the United States will not need to do anything to get the new service, as WarnerMedia revised deals with distributors, including Apple Inc, Charter Communications Inc, Hulu and most recently, Comcast Corp. But subscribers of HBO through Amazon.com Inc and Roku Inc are out of luck as WarnerMedia has yet to strike new agreements. For these and new customers, WarnerMedia is offering a promotion for subscribing directly with the company: $3 off the regular $15 price. Some AT&T customers will also get it at no additional cost. HBO Max will feature 10,000 hours of content from WarnerMedia brands and libraries such as Warner Bros, New Line Cinema and Cartoon Network. At launch, it will include six original titles, including \"Love Life,\" a romantic comedy anthology series featuring Anna Kendrick, and a Sesame Workshop"}

China demand Monday that Washington withdraw export sanctions imposed on Chinese companies in the latest round of a worsening conflict over technology, security and human rights. The foreign ministry accused the Trump administration of interfering in China's affairs by adding eight companies accused of playing roles in a crackdown in its Muslim northwestern region of Xinjiang to an export blacklist. Washington also imposed controls on access to American technology for 24 companies and government-linked entities it said might be involved in obtaining goods with potential military uses. The US decision \u201cviolated basic norms of international relations\" and \"harmed China \u2019s interests,\u201d said a ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian. \u201cWe urge the United States to correct its mistakes, revoke the relevant decision and stop interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs,\" Zhao said. The measures announced Friday expand a US campaign against Chinese companies including tech giant Huawei that Washington says might be security threats.

British low-cost airline easyJet said it planned to cut up to 30 percent of its staff, or 4,500 jobs, and shrink its fleet to fit the smaller market it expects to emerge from the collapse in air travel due to Covid-19. EasyJet, which employs over 15,000 people in eight countries across Europe, said it would launch a consultation process with its staff in the coming days, acting later than many of its airline peers to announce job cuts as a result of the pandemic. The novel coronavirus has brought airlines across the world to their knees, grounding planes and forcing them to make tens of thousands of job cuts as they prepare for a travel market that will take three years to recover. Ryanair, EasyJet's bigger low cost rival, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have over the last month announced 18,000 job cuts between them. EasyJet over the last month has been grappling with an investor vote on management strategy as well as a cyber attack. It said on Thursday that it was planning to fly around 30 percent of its capacity later this year, and that it expected to shrink its aircraft numbers to around 302 planes, about 51 aircraft lower than it had been planning for 2021 prior to Covid-19.

Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was dealt a setback by a Canadian court on Wednesday as she tries to avoid extradition to the United States to face bank fraud charges, dashing hopes for an end to her 18-month house arrest in Vancouver. The ruling, which could further deteriorate relations between Ottawa and Beijing, elicited immediate strong reaction from China's embassy in Canada, which said Canada is \"accomplice to United States efforts to bring down Huawei and Chinese high-tech companies.\" Meng, a Chinese citizen and daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder Ren Zheng, was arrested in December 2018 on a warrant issued by US authorities. They accuse her of bank fraud for misleading HSBC about Huawei's relationship with a company operating in Iran, putting HSBC at risk of fines and penalties for breaking US sanctions on Tehran. Meng's lawyers argued the case should be thrown out because Canada did not have sanctions against Iran. But British Columbia's Superior Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes disagreed, ruling the legal standard of double criminality had been met. \"Ms. Meng's approach ... would seriously limit Canada's ability to fulfill its international obligations in the extradition context for fraud and other economic crimes,\" Holmes said. Huawei said it was disappointed by the Canadian court ruling and it expects that Canada's judicial system will ultimately prove her innocence. The ruling paves the way for the extradition hearing to proceed to the second phase starting June, examining whether Canadian officials followed the law while arresting Meng. Closing arguments are expected in the last week of September and first week of October. Reid Weingarten, a US lawyer for Meng, said Meng should \"not be a pawn or a hostage\" in the China-US relationship. Ties between the two superpowers are deteriorating steadily amid disputes over trade and the future of Hong Kong. \"Today's ruling in Canada is only the opening salvo in a very long process ... we are confident that ultimately justice will be done,\" Weingarten said.

Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings will invest $70 billion over the next five years in technology infrastructure including cloud computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, the company said Tuesday. The announcement comes after call by Beijing last month for a tech-driven structural upgrade of the world's second-largest economy through investment in \"new infrastructure\" and a boom in demand for business software and cloud services. Other key sectors of the investment include blockchain, servers, big data centres, supercomputer centres, internet of things operating systems, 5G networks and quantum computing, Dowson Tong, senior executive vice president of Tencent, told state media in an interview. Tencent is best-known for its WeChat messaging app and a range of popular games but is aiming to expand into business services as consumer internet growth slows and companies shift number-crunching from their own computers to the cloud. Tencent shares were 2.5% higher following the announcement. Tencent has said while cloud businesses suffered amid the Covid-19 outbreak it expected to see accelerated cloud services and enterprise software adoption from offline industries and public sectors over the longer term. \"Expediting the 'new infrastructure' strategy will help further cement virus containment success,\" Guangming Daily quoted Tong as saying. Tencent Cloud had 18% of China's cloud market in the fourth quarter, trailing Alibaba Group Holding Ltd which commanded 46.4%, according to research firm Canalys.

The EU's executive is proposing an $825 billion recovery fund to help the bloc's economy through the painful recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said Wednesday. Gentiloni, who is in charge of economic affairs at the commission, wrote in a tweet that the move is \u201ca European turning point to face an unprecedented crisis\u201d.

The energy industry is set to suffer a record drop in investment due to the coronavirus fallout, the IEA said on Wednesday, and while renewables are likely to fare better than oil, any swift economic recovery could create a global fuel crunch. In its annual report on energy investments, the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated the plunge will be of the order of one-fifth from 2019 levels, or almost $400 billion, as firms slash spending amid slumping demand for energy. Shale oil producers that catapulted the United States to the world's top crude nation stand to suffer the worst decline, the IEA said. \"All the energy sectors - oil, gas, renewables - everything is affected but the biggest impact is on shale oil,\" the agency's director Fatih Birol said in an interview. \"Total oil investments we expect to decline one third this year whereas the shale industry will see a decline of about 50 percent.\" However, spending in renewable power projects is expected to fall by only around 10 percent for the year, the report said. \"Even though this 'clean' spending is set to dip in 2020, its share in total energy investment is set to rise,\" it noted. But it noted \"these investment levels remain far short of what would be required to put the world on a more sustainable pathway,\" estimating that spending on renewable power would need to double by the late 2020s. Crisis to come? The IEA has long warned that insufficient investment may leave the industry unable to meet rising demand. \"There is a risk that today\u2019s cutbacks lead to future market imbalances, prompting new energy price cycles or volatility,\" it said. If oil investment stays at 2020 levels then supply in 2025 would be 9 million barrels per day less than had been expected, the IEA estimated, which could mean tight markets and higher prices if demand resumes it pre-crisis rising trajectory.

Demonstrators defied coronavirus restrictions to march in cities across Ecuador on Monday in protest against President Lenin Moreno's drastic economic measures to tackle the crisis. Moreno last week announced public spending cuts including the closure of state companies and embassies around the world, but trade unions Monday said workers were paying a disproportionate price compared to Ecuador's elite. \"This protest is because the government is firing workers to avoid making the rich pay,\" Mecias Tatamuez, head of the county's largest union, the Unitary Front of Workers (FUT), told reporters at a march in Quito. Around 2,000 people marched in the capital, waving flags and banners and shouting anti-government slogans. The protesters wore masks and respected distancing measures recommended against the spread of the coronavirus that has caused at least 3,200 deaths in the country, making it South America's worst hit nation per capita. Authorities say more than 2,000 further deaths are likely linked to the virus. Demonstrations took place in several other cities, including Guayaquil, the epicenter of Ecuador's health crisis, where union leaders said hundreds marched through the city. Moreno ordered the closure of Ecuadoran embassies, a reduction in diplomatic staff and scrapped seven state companies as part of measures designed to save some $4 billion. He also announced the liquidation of the TAME airline, which has lost more than $400 million over the last five years. The government says the pandemic has so far cost the economy at least $8 billion. Public sector working hours have been cut by 25 percent, with an accompanying 16 percent pay cut. Moreno said on Sunday that 150,000 people had lost their jobs because of the coronavirus. Ecuador was struggling economically before the pandemic hit, due to high debt and its dependence on oil. The IMF predicts that the economy will shrink by 6.3 percent this year, the sharpest drop of any country in South America."}

Nearly 3 million laid-off workers applied for US unemployment benefits last week as the viral outbreak led more companies to slash jobs even though most states have begun to let some businesses reopen under certain restrictions. The wave of layoffs may not subside until Congress can agree on providing rescue aid for financially desperate state and local governments as well as further help for households. Republicans and the Trump administration are locked in a standoff with Democrats, who have proposed trillions more in aid beyond the nearly $3 trillion already allocated to individuals and businesses. Republican leaders say they want to first see how previous aid affects the economy and have expressed skepticism about approving much more spending now. Roughly 36 million people have now filed for jobless aid in the two months since the coronavirus first forced millions of businesses to close their doors and shrink their workforces, the Labor Department said on Thursday. An additional 842,000 people applied for aid last week through a separate federal program set up for the self-employed and gig workers. All told, the figures point to a job market gripped by its worst crisis in decades and an economy that is sinking into a severe downturn. The report suggests the tentative reopening of some businesses in many states has done little to reverse the flow of mass layoffs. Last week\u2019s pace of new applications for aid is four times the record high that prevailed before the coronavirus struck hard in March. Jobless workers in some states are still reporting difficulty applying for or receiving benefits. These include freelance, gig and self-employed workers, who became newly eligible for jobless aid this year. In Georgia, one of the first states to partially reopen its economy, the number of unemployment claims rose last week to 241,000.

French car plants are only just starting to rev up production after the coronavirus lockdown, which hit the auto sector badly, and Macron wants to accelerate the transition to electric cars to help revive the industry. \"We need a motivational goal: make France Europe's top producer of clean vehicles by bringing output (up) to more than one million electric and hybrid cars per year over the next five years,\" Macron told a news conference. To achieve that goal, he said France would increase the state bonus for consumers buying electric cars to $7,689 from $6,590. But to help dealerships sell the 400,000 vehicles left unsold because of the lockdown, Macron said people buying a traditional car would also receive a $3,294 bonus under a scheme that would apply to three-quarters of households. \"Our fellow citizens need to buy more vehicles, and in particular clean ones. Not in two, five or 10 years - now,\" Macron said following a visit to a Valeo car parts factory in northern France. No car model currently produced in France should be manufactured abroad, he said. Renault, which produces its Zoe electric model in France, had pledged to make a future Renault-Nissan electric engine in France and not in Asia, as initially envisaged, he said. The government will not sign off on a planned 5 billion euro state loan for Renault until management and unions conclude talks over the carmaker's French workforce and plants in France, Macron said.

Agriculture, one of the oldest forms of human subsistence, is facing the heat of the pandemic as farmers across the world are changing their ways to cultivate soil. American corn producers are shifting from corn to soybeans as ethanol production is facing a major decline in light of the pandemic. With people being forced to stay at home, energy markets are in turmoil, diminishing the demand for ethanol. Ethanol, which is mostly extracted from corn, is used as an alternative fuel to run cars. Most ethanol plants are located across American Midwest because much of the country\u2019s corn production is concentrated there. Most cars on the US roads run with a 10 percent mixture of ethanol. Ethanol-blended fuel is commonly used in Brazil and several European countries as well. \u201cThe impact on the ethanol industry has been swift and sharp. Deeply negative operating margins and falling consumption have led to dramatic cuts in ethanol production,\u201d wrote Renewable Fuels Association, in a report published in late April. \u201cFor the week ended April 10, ethanol production was 44 percent below the same time in 2019, hitting the lowest level since the EIA (US Energy Information Administration) began reporting statistics in 2010,\u201d the report said.

Facebook's effort comes as it leans more heavily on AI to filter out objectionable content during the coronavirus pandemic that has sidelined most of its human moderators. Its quarterly transparency report said Facebook removed some 9.6 million posts for violating \"hate speech\" policies in the first three months of this year, including 4.7 million pieces of content \"connected to organized hate.\" Facebook said AI has become better tuned at filtering as the social network turns more to machines as a result of the lockdowns.

Meanwhile the Reserve Bank of Australia expects the rate to increase to 10 percent. Australia posted its biggest monthly jobs decline on record on Thursday because of coronavirus lockdown measures, even as the country begins to gradually ease social distancing rules. The jobless figures from the country's statistics office provided a stark illustration of the pandemic's effect on the national economy, which had experienced an unbroken run of growth for more than two decades. \"This is a tough day for Australia, a very tough day,\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a televised media briefing. \"Terribly shocking, although not unexpected.\" The Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed 594,300 jobs were lost in April, the largest fall on record. The unemployment rate shot up to 6.2 percent, the highest since September 2015, from 5.2 percent in March. That was lower than the 8.3 percent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, largely due to a significant decline in the number of people looking for work. Economists said the \"jobseeker\" payment launched by the government to help businesses retain staff during the crisis had also masked the full impact. Worse is expected, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last week forecasting unemployment to hit about 10 percent as the local economy shrinks by 8 percent in the year to June. Australia imposed strict social distancing measures in March to tackle the pandemic, closing its borders to all non-citizens and ordering people to stay home unless on essential business. Pubs, sports centres, libraries and other public buildings were closed while cafes and restaurants were restricted to takeaway services.

The International Monetary Fund's executive board approved on Tuesday a $5 billion loan deal for Ukraine that Kiev says is needed to stave off default as the coronavirus pandemic plunges the Eastern European country's economy into recession. Ukraine will receive an immediate disbursement of about $2.1 billion from the 18-month Stand-By Arrangement, the IMF said in a statement. \"That's $200 mln more than originally planned,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on his official Twitter account. \"The new program funding will help us to overcome the challenges caused by #Covid 19. The #IMF has proven itself to be a reliable partner to a friend in need.\" The rest of the funds will be spread over four reviews during the program, which focuses more on stability than deep structural reforms, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement. Vote of confidence? Zelenskiy's government has trumpeted the agreement as a vote of confidence in its ability to deliver reforms, including a banking law that went against the interests of one of the country's wealthiest tycoons. One of Europe's poorest countries, Ukraine does not have the financial firepower for major stimulus measures to keep its economy afloat after imposing a nationwide lockdown in March that has shuttered or restricted many businesses. Securing the IMF funds also is expected to unlock financing from the European Union and other institutions. Ukraine's economy is seen contracting around 5% this year, including a 12 percent second-quarter drop. The country has recorded 27,856 confirmed coronavirus cases, with 810 deaths, although the lockdown is gradually being lifted. To secure the IMF deal, Ukraine had to pass legislation that prevents the former owners of insolvent banks from regaining their assets. The move was viewed as aimed against the interests of Ihor Kolomoisky, who formerly owned the country's largest lender, PrivatBank - nationalised in 2016 - and who has waged a legal battle to regain control or receive government compensation."}

But the days of lavish spending may soon be over as the deadly coronavirus has struck the city hard. The pandemic has brought its economy to a standstill, severely affecting this commercial hub, which is one among the seven Emirati states comprising the UAE.

Prosecutors on Thursday asked the court to issue an arrest warrant against Lee, culminating a probe into accounting fraud and a controversial 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates that they said helped facilitate Lee's plan to assume greater control of the group.

It must have come as a rude awakening for gold enthusiasts - the price of the precious metal, which was being touted as one of the safest assets to preserve value amid the pandemic, is under pressure. Last week saw the bullion drop 2.4 percent, the largest weekly plunge in more than two months, according to Reuters. As of Monday afternoon, the price was around $1,682 per ounce as a consequence of the reopening of economies in many countries. This price is still up more than 11 percent this year and has increased steadily with just a few bumps. An improvement in US unemployment figures and hopes that an economic recovery will push up the price of other assets such as stocks, have hit the price of gold.

What does the novel coronavirus need to keep spreading? Plenty of people, crammed spaces, proximity and perhaps a bit of oversight. Airports and airlines meet all those requirements. When thousands of people from different countries or cities are converging at one place, the job of maintaining social distancing becomes a daunting challenge. The fact that many of the Covid-19 patients don\u2019t show any symptoms make the job of aviation officials to fight the pathogen even more difficult. Air travel has come to a near halt with jets being grounded and airlines going belly up under the weight of financial difficulties. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says passenger traffic dropped more than 50 percent in March. The biggest worry for the aviation industry is to find a way to restore the confidence of the travellers who have a lot to worry about - from someone's sneeze or cough to a maskless traveller sitting nearby. There will be elevator buttons and stair rails that people will hesitate to touch. And toddlers will be toddlers. They'll run around, touching walls and the floor. To face this new reality, changes are being considered at multiple levels. Say bye to farewells At the airports, people can expect to see a major alteration in their travelling experience. The most apparent change is going to be a restriction on non-fliers from coming to the airports. Istanbul\u2019s Sabiha Gokcen airport, which is set to reopen for domestic flights from May 28, has already barred relatives from accompanying passengers.

A South Korean court on Tuesday declined to issue an arrest warrant for the heir to the country's Samsung empire over a controversial merger of two business units seen as a key step to his succession. Lee Jae-Yong, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, is already being re-tried on charges of bribery, embezzlement and other offences in connection with a corruption scandal that brought down former South Korean President Park Geun-Hye. The merger case is separate from his ongoing retrial, but adds to the difficulties for the Samsung group, by far the biggest of the family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebols, that dominate business in the world's 12th-largest economy. Prosecutors had sought the arrest warrant for Lee on suspicion he was involved in price manipulation and illegal trading during the 2015 merger of Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T. But the Seoul Central District Court turned down the prosecution's request, ruling there was not sufficient probable cause for his arrest or those of two former Samsung executives. \"There was an insufficient explanation on the need to arrest the defendants against the principle of trial without detention,\" Judge Won Jung-sook said in a court statement. \"Prosecutors seem to have already secured a considerable amount of evidence through their investigation,\" she said. Whether Lee committed illegal acts should be established at trial, she added.

He emerged at about 2:40 am Tuesday and briefly greeted reporters but did not answer when asked how he felt about the decision. Lee then left in a black sedan.

Japan\u2019s economy is still in recession but contracted at a smaller rate than initially estimated for the first quarter, according to government data released Monday. The difference was large because private-sector demand had not dropped as much as previously estimated. The Cabinet Office said the economy shrank at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in January-March, better than the 3.4 percent contraction given earlier. The annual rate is the projected number if the same level of growth or contraction in that quarter lasted for a whole year.

Uncertainty remains, and the numbers may remain dismal for the April-June period. Yoshimasa Maruyama, the chief market economist for SMBC Nikko Securities, said the upward revision in the latest quarter GDP was not surprising, and, given the reopening of economies worldwide from shutdowns over the outbreak, a recovery was likely, helped by pent-up demand. \u201cThe Japanese economy will rebound very quickly, but after that, it will again falter and stall,\u201d he said, as other problems won\u2019t disappear even if the fallout from Covid-19 can be brought under control.

Zuckerberg did not promise specific policy changes in a Facebook post, days after staff members walked off the job, some claiming he kept finding new excuses not to challenge Trump. \"I know many of you think we should have labelled the President's posts in some way last week,\" Zuckerberg wrote, referring to his decision not to remove Trump's message containing the phrase \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" \"We're going to review our policies allowing discussion and threats of state use of force to see if there are any amendments we should adopt,\" he wrote. \"We're going to review potential options for handling violating or partially-violating content aside from the binary leave-it-up or take-it-down decisions.\" Zuckerberg said Facebook would be more transparent about its decision-making on whether to take down posts, review policies on posts that could cause voter suppression and would look to build software to advance racial justice, led by important lieutenants. At a staff meeting earlier this week, employees questioned Zuckerberg's stance on Trump's post. Zuckerberg, who holds a controlling stake in Facebook, has maintained that while he found Trump's comments \"deeply offensive,\" they did not violate company policy against incitements to violence. Facebook's policy is either to take down a post or leave it up, without any other options. Now, Zuckerberg said, other possibilities would be considered. However, he added, \"I worry that this approach has a risk of leading us to editorialise on content we don't like even if it doesn't violate our policies.\""}

Somebody wasn\u2019t able to make good on a futures oil contract and the price collapsed. And Twitter slipped into a frenzy. The price of oil in the United States went into negative territory for the first time since prospectors began filling wooden barrels with black gold in the 1860s. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate Crude to be delivered in May was minus $37.63 on Monday amidst concerns that so little is being consumed that all the storage tanks are full. Demand for oil has dropped around the world in the wake of the coronavirus lockdowns, which governments have enforced to stop people from travelling in cars or planes. A negative price basically means that someone was willing to give $37 a barrel to get rid of the oil in hand - something inconceivable for a lot of people. It quickly turned into a trending subject on Twitter, where most of the users found joy in powerful traders taking a hammering. Such a steep decline doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that oil has stopped exchanging hands altogether or that there isn\u2019t much value left in the world's most traded commodity. The price of WTI crude for delivery in June is around $21 - still much lower than the $60 price in January. Brent Crude, the international benchmark for price that is more widely used, was trading at $25.57 per barrel. But physical delivery of a barrel of oil ( you need to trade in at least a 1,000 barrels) is one thing and investors trying to make money out of the expected price shifts is another. The below zero price scenario played out in the futures market where actual traders buy and sell oil along with Wall Street investors who try to make money off such a fluctuation. A futures market is where banks and brokers trade commodities such as oil and coffee. As it turns out, Tuesday, April 21, was the last day to close the futures contracts for"}

Zynn, a product of China's number-two video app maker Kuaishou, launched in May became the most popular free app in the US Apple App Store just a month later.

Oil\u2019s chaotic collapse deepened, and stocks around the world dropped on Tuesday as the economic carnage caused by the coronavirus pandemic turns markets upside down. A day after oil futures plunged below zero for the first time, traders in one corner of the US crude market were still close to paying others to take it off their hands. That's a market quirk created by a glut of oil, which has traders running out of places to store it in the near term. Prices remain well above zero for oil elsewhere in the world and for deliveries further into the future, which analysts consider to be closer to the \u201ctrue\u201d price of crude.

Australia will pass legislation within months obliging Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google to share advertising revenue with local media firms, the country's treasurer said on Monday, becoming one of the first countries to require digital platforms to pay for content they use. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement the move comes after talks with Facebook and Alphabet failed to yield a voluntary code to address complaints by domestic media players that the tech giants have too tight a grip on advertising, their main source of income. \"On the fundamental issue of payment for content, which the code was seeking to resolve, there was no meaningful progress,\" the treasurer said in a separate opinion piece in The Australian newspaper. Australia's online advertising market is worth about worth almost $5.72 billion a year and has grown more than eight-fold since 2005, Frydenberg wrote. For every $64 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook. Last December, Australia said Google and Facebook would have to agree to new rules to ensure they do not abuse their market power and damage competition, or the government would impose new controls.

US airlines are slashing hundreds of thousands of flights, cutting schedules by 80% or more through at least June and parking thousands of jets as demand for tickets has plunged by about 95%.

In response to the Covid-19 outbreak in late 2019, Hangzhou-based startup Rokid developed a pair of glasses to help screen for symptoms. Rokid Vice President Xiang Wenjie says demand has risen for the company's T1 glasses, developed in only two weeks, after it sold roughly 1,000 pairs to governments, industrial parks and schools. \"Apart from fixed temperature measurement, T1 can provide portable, distant and prompt temperature checking, which would be a great help,\" Xiang said. Equipped with an infrared sensor and a camera, the glasses allow the wearer to \"see\" peoples' temperatures. Rokid says on its website that it completed a round of \"billion-dollar\" financing in 2018, led by Singapore state investor Temasek, Swiss bank Credit Suisse and others. The company said it is now is upgrading the T1 to take multiple temperature readings simultaneously for use in places like malls and airports. One office park in Hangzhou is replacing fixed thermometer stands with glasses after a flood of employees returning to work made temperature checks a headache for property management. \"With more new products coming out, especially these glasses, we think we can use them to conduct contactless temperature measurement, they are very efficient when faced with a big crowd of people,\" said Jin Keli, president of Greentown Property Management.

The Lebanese government on Thursday approved a long-awaited plan to rescue the debt-saddled economy from its worst crisis in decades, following a fresh wave of angry street protests. A lockdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic has added to the economic woes besetting the country, which include soaring inflation, a liquidity crunch and a plummeting currency. Demonstrators in northern Lebanon have attacked banks and clashed with security forces for three consecutive nights, re-energising a protest movement launched in October against a political class the activists deem inept and corrupt. The government unanimously approved the economic plan after minor amendments, the presidency said on Twitter following a cabinet meeting in the presidential palace in Baabda. President Michel Aoun called it a \"historic day\" for Lebanon. \"It is the first time the government approves an economic-financial plan after the country was almost driven to ruin because of the lack of planning,\" he said in comments carried by the official National News Agency. Diab said that the \"practical plan that includes an economic vision for the future of Lebanon\" will put the country back on track. Leaks on the economic plan to Lebanese media suggest the country needs $80 billion in funds to exit the crisis, including $10 to $15 billion in external financing in the next five years.

{"title": "German economy faces 'worst recession in history'", "content": "\"We will experience the worst recession in the history of the federal republic\" founded in 1949, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in Berlin. The German economy will suffer the biggest slump in its history this year over the coronavirus crisis, the government warned on Wednesday, pushing Europe's top economy into a painful recession. German gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to shrink by a record 6.3 percent as demand for exports plummets and lockdown restrictions weigh on domestic consumption, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in Berlin. \"We will experience the worst recession in the history of the federal republic\" founded in 1949, Altmaier said. \"The effects of the coronavirus pandemic will push our economy into a recession after 10 years of growth.\" This year's forecast drop in GDP is worse than during the global financial crisis in 2009, when Germany's economy contracted by more than five percent. If the government's projection is confirmed, 2020 will mark the biggest contraction since federal statistics authority Destatis began keeping records in 1970. The government offered a glimmer of hope however, predicting that the economy would bounce back in 2021 and grow by 5.2 percent as the virus impact wanes and businesses reopen. Altmaier pointed out that the global economy as a whole is expect to tip into recession as the world battles the coronavirus fallout, with the International Monetary Fund predicting a worldwide contraction of 2.8 percent in 2020. Export champion Germany in particular will feel the pain from disruptions to supply chains and lower demand for made-in-Germany goods from abroad, he said. Exports are expected to plunge by 11.6 percent in 2020, according to the Economy Ministry. Job fears and coronavirus restrictions that have kept shops and entertainment venues closed are set to weigh heavily on demand at home too, dealing a blow to the key growth driver of domestic consumption. International demand and supply shocks will also sap appetite for producer goods in Germany, Altmaier said.

Europe is the region worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic so far with more than half of the global death toll coming from the continent. Italy has the second highest death toll of all countries to date, with more than 27,682 deaths, followed closely by the UK with just over 26,000. Healthcare systems have struggled to cope across the area with countries facing particular difficulty trying to secure stocks of protective equipment. While hospitals feel the strain, the fear of further spikes in cases is keeping much of the economy under lockdown at great cost. Given the great disparity between the economies of states, even within the EU, some will be better prepared to handle the fallout of the crisis than others. According to data collected by The Economist , southern European countries are more vulnerable economically to the coronavirus compared to those in the north. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Eurozone economies will contract by 7.5 percent in 2020 , with Italy suffering from a fall in GDP of 9.1 percent and Spain suffering from an 8 percent contraction. The disparity is down to the starkly different ways in which the states were struck by the pandemic, as well as the nature of their economic activity. Some countries, for example, have economies that rely more heavily on face-to-face interactions, such as retail or the service sector, or manufacturing, than others, where the technology industry may dominate. This is illustrated by the fact that 68 percent of jobs in Greece cannot be done from home while in Sweden the same measure lies at 56 percent. Data compiled by The Economist magazine indicates that countries in southern Europe are less flexible because they do not have as many jobs that can be done from home. In these countries, retail, hospitality, and transport sectors make up a greater proportion of the overall economy than their northern counterparts.

Some 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy, representing nearly half of the global labour force, are in immediate danger of losing their livelihoods due to the coronavirus pandemic, the International Labour Organization (ILO) said on Wednesday. The UN agency's latest report sharply raised its forecast for the devastating impact on jobs and incomes of the Covid-19 disease, which has infected more than 3.1 million people globally, killed nearly 220,000 and shut down economies. \"It shows I think in the starkest possible terms that the jobs employment crisis and all of its consequences is deepening by comparison with our estimates of three weeks ago,\" ILO Director-General Guy Ryder told a briefing, foreseeing a \"massive\" poverty impact. Already, wages of the world's two billion informal workers plunged by an estimated global average of 60 percent in the first month that the crisis unfolded in each region, the ILO said. Informal workers are the most vulnerable of the 3.3 billion global workforce, lacking welfare protection, access to good healthcare, or the means to work from home, it stressed. \"For millions of workers, no income means no food, no security and no future. Millions of businesses around the world are barely breathing,\" said Ryder. \"They have no savings or access to credit. These are the real faces of the world of work.

African leaders, the IMF and the World Bank on Friday appealed for rapid international action to help African countries respond to the coronavirus pandemic that will cause the continent's economy to shrink by 1.25 percent in 2020, the worst reading on record. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told ministers, UN officials and others that the African continent lacked the resources and healthcare capacity to address the crisis, and needed at least $114 billion to cover urgent fiscal needs. Even after pledges of support from bilateral, multilateral and private creditors, Africa faced a gap of around $44 billion, officials told the \"Mobilizing with Africa\" conference held online during the spring meetings of the World Bank and IMF. \"This pandemic has already had a devastating impact on Africa and its effects will deepen as the rate of infection rises.

Telefonica has been weighing options for the mobile business since 2016 when a previous 10.3 billion pound deal takeover of O2 by Three UK, controlled by CK Hutchison Holdings, was blocked by European antitrust regulators, banking sources said. A combination of O2 and Virgin Media would reshape Britain's telecoms industry, leaving Hutchison and Vodafone stranded without their own fixed-line consumer networks. If successful, the deal would end uncertainty around the fate of one Britain's biggest mobile operators after it was repeatedly touted as a possible candidate for a sale or a stock listing in recent years. It would also offer Telefonica a way to partially cash out from O2 while retaining a presence in Britain, which the company sees as one of its \"core markets\" along with Spain, Germany and Brazil. Malone, who transformed the pay-TV sector in the United States, combined Liberty's Dutch operations with Vodafone's in 2016 in a joint venture deal which could offer the blueprint for a merger of O2 and Virgin Media, one of the sources said. He added that discussions between Telefonica and Liberty were focusing on creating a joint venture equally owned by the two firms. Shares in Liberty were up 8.75 percent at $21.12 on the news.

US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was confident the coronavirus may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence, ratcheting up tensions with Beijing over the origins of the deadly disease. Trump did not mince words at a White House event on Thursday, when asked if he had seen evidence that gave him a \"high degree of confidence\" the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. \"Yes, yes I have,\" he said, declining to give specifics. \"I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that.\" The Chinese state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology has dismissed the allegations, and other US officials have downplayed their likelihood. Most experts believe the virus originated in a market selling wildlife in Wuhan and jumped from animals to people. The Republican president has shown increasing frustration with China in recent weeks over the pandemic, which has cost tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone, sparked an economic contraction, and threatened his chances of re-election in November. Trump said previously his administration was trying to determine whether the coronavirus emanated from the Wuhan lab, following media reports it may have been artificially synthesised at a China state-backed laboratory or perhaps escaped from such a facility. The coronavirus outbreak has contributed to a deepening rift between the Trump administration and China, with Beijing suggesting the US military might have brought the coronavirus to China and Trump saying China failed to alert the world to coronavirus risks in a timely and transparent fashion.

Apple released a new iPhone that is vastly cheaper than the models it rolled out last fall when the economy was booming and the pandemic had yet to force people to rethink their spending. The second-generation iPhone SE introduced on Wednesday will sell for as little as $399, a 40 percent markdown from the most affordable iPhone 11 unveiled last year. Higher-end versions of the iPhone 11 sell for more than $1,000. Online orders for the iPhone SE will begin on Friday, with the first deliveries expected April 24. Even before the pandemic, many people had begun to balk at the substantial price tags for smartphones that weren't that much better than the ones they already owned. That pushed Apple to step up its emphasis on music and video services to the more than 1 billion people who carry around at least one of their internet-connected devices. High-priced gadgets are expected to become an even tougher sell as the economy plunges into its deepest downturn in more than a decade. Apple maps out its products many months in advance and the new iPhone SE isn't a direct response to the economic meltdown hatched by the pandemic.

Roughly 22 million have now sought jobless benefits in the past month \u2013 easily the worst stretch of US job losses on record. It means that roughly one in seven workers have lost their jobs in that time. The grim figures point to an economy that is tumbling into what appears to be a calamitous recession, the worst in decades. The nation\u2019s output could shrink by roughly 10.5 percent before it starts to rebound, according to Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. That would be more than double the contraction that occurred during the 2008-2009 recession, which was the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. All businesses deemed nonessential have been closed in nearly every state. Deep job losses have been inflicted across nearly every industry. Some economists say the unemployment rate could reach as high as 20 percent in April, which would be the highest rate since the Great Depression of the 1930s. By comparison, unemployment never topped 10 percent during the Great Recession. Layoffs are spreading beyond service industries like hotels, bars and restaurants, which absorbed the brunt of the initial job cuts, into white collar professional occupations, including software programmers, construction workers and sales people.

China's economy contracted for the first time in decades last quarter as drastic measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic brought activity to a standstill, official data showed Friday. Gross domestic product shrank 6.8 percent in the January-March quarter from the same period a year earlier, according to figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). It was the first negative growth reported by the world's second-largest economy since Beijing began logging quarterly data in the early 1990s. The figure marks a sharp drop from China's six percent expansion in the fourth quarter of last year, but was slightly better than the 8.2 percent contraction forecast by economists in an AFP poll. Economists have long harboured doubts about the accuracy of the official Chinese data, however, suspecting that the numbers are massaged for political reasons.

Losses from a protracted blockade of Libya's vital oil files and ports have surpassed $4 billion, the country's national oil corporation said on Tuesday, amid an escalation of fighting between the UN-recognised government and warlord Khalifa Haftar's militia. Powerful tribes loyal to Haftar seized large export terminals and choked off major pipelines in January, aiming to starve the Tripoli-based government of crucial revenues. The eastern-based Haftar militia launched an offensive last April to capture Tripoli, clashing with an array of forces loosely allied with the UN-supported government.

As Turkey eases the measures it introduced in response to the novel coronavirus, all major automotive factories in the country will restart operations by May 11, the country's industry and technology minister said on Tuesday. \"A large chunk of automotive factories have already restarted production,\" Mustafa Varank told an Ankara Chamber of Commerce online meeting. He also said some textile firms are back in operation, and with the normalisation of malls and export channels, this sector will recover fast. After resuming operations, factories should plan practices to guarantee the health of their personnel, he said. \"Every detail is very important from the sitting order in the services to the shifts in the factory,\" he added. After the worldwide spread of coronavirus from China, many factories had to halt production due to measures to stem the virus\u2019 spread, such as lockdowns. In Turkey, factories were not closed completely, even during curfew periods when the government allowed some companies to continue working as they could have faced huge losses in the event of closure, he underlined. Some 16,900 firms continued their operations during this period, he added. Noting that China also faced manufacturing problems, Varank said Turkey had the potential to become a supply centre for global companies. Measures against pandemic Underlining that rate of recovery from the virus has surpassed infections in Turkey, Varank said three million employees had benefited from the country's wage supports introduced to help tackle the pandemic's economic impact. The government had also distributed aid of 1,000 Turkish liras ($141) to 4.5 million low-income households, he added. In the course of the outbreak, Turkey did not face shortages of medical equipment or food and even began to mass-produce an indigenous mechanical ventilator in just two weeks, said Varank.

The Iranian parliament has agreed to cross four zeros out from the banknotes, making it easier for people to transact without wasting time calculating the price of eggs or chicken, which can run into tens of thousands of rials. Over the next two to five years, Iranian rials will be taken out of circulation and replaced with the toman - one toman will be equal to 10,000 rials. \u201cIt will have more of a psychological impact as instead of paying 250,000 rials for a packet of eggs, you\u2019ll pay just 25 tomans,\u201d an Iran-based journalist told TRT World . A cosmetic change? High inflation, a years-long headache for Iranians, has eroded the value of the rial. It costs more than 150,000 rials to buy one US dollar in the open market while the official exchange rate is pegged at 42,000 rials to one US dollar. Iranians have long abandoned calculating prices in rials in their everyday affairs. Instead, a customer or trader might use the rial as a currency but quote prices in tomans with one toman equal to 10 rials at the moment.

As governments around the world consider how to monitor new coronavirus outbreaks while reopening their societies, many are starting to bet on smartphone apps to help stanch the pandemic. But their decisions on which technologies to use, and how far those allow authorities to peer into private lives, are highlighting some uncomfortable tradeoffs between protecting the privacy and public health. \u201cThere are conflicting interests,\u201d said Tina White, a Stanford University researcher who first introduced a privacy-protecting approach in February. \u201cGovernments and public health (agencies) want to be able to track people\u201d to minimise the spread of Covid-19, but people are less likely to download a voluntary app if it is intrusive, she said.

Today, that means identifying people who test positive for the novel coronavirus, tracking down others they might have infected, and preventing further spread by quarantining everyone who might be contagious. That second step requires an army of healthcare workers to question coronavirus carriers about recent contacts so those people can be tested and potentially isolated.

The country has enjoyed success in curbing the spread of Covid-19, with new daily cases slowing to single digits or zero across most regions. But Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said measures to curb coronavirus were dealing a heavy blow to the economy, with GDP forecast to fall 10 percent in the June quarter. \"For every extra week that the current restrictions remain in place, the treasury estimates that close to $4 billion will be reduced in economic activity, from a combination of ... reduced workforce participation, reduced productivity, and reduced consumption,\" he said. The estimate came as the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported a 7.5 percent drop in jobs \u2013 which it said was equivalent to about 700,000 workers out of an active workforce of some 13 million \u2013 in the five weeks to April 18. A third of workers in the worst-affected hotel and hospitality industries lost their jobs, along with 27 percent of people in the arts and recreation sectors.

However, business optimism is edging up as a gradual restart comes into view. Britain's economy is on course for an unprecedented 7 percent quarterly contraction after measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus forced company closures across the country last month, a business survey showed on Tuesday. Adding to the bleak mood, figures earlier on Tuesday showed monthly car sales had dropped to their lowest since 1946 due to the closure of showrooms, while around a quarter of workers are now on a government-funded furlough. IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the services sector fell to its lowest since the survey started in 1996, dropping to 13.4 in April from 34.5 in March, only a fraction better than an initial flash estimate of 12.3. Last week's manufacturing PMI was similarly dire and IHS Markit said that, taken together, they pointed to the deepest economic downturn \"in living memory.\" A composite PMI of the two sectors dropped to a record-low 13.8 in April from 36.0 in March, far below the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction, indicating a 7 percent quarterly fall in gross domestic product, IHS Markit said. \"We expect the actual decline in GDP could be even greater,\" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.

Videogame sales in the United States surged in the last two months as the virus shut down the country, with sales in March hitting their highest in over a decade. \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\" is the best-selling game of this year so far according to data from research firm NPD. The company also released a free-to-play battle-royale extension \"Call of Duty: Warzone\" in March, which it said had already recorded over 60 million players to date. Activision has been pushing to increase user engagement on its big-budget titles by offering free content like new multi-player maps, hoping to boost in-game spending. In some markets like India, Latin America and Eastern Europe - where consoles are expensive for most - the mobile version of \"Call of Duty\" is growing rapidly, Bobby Kotick, chief executive officer, told Reuters. The company's mobile game unit - \"Candy Crush\" maker King - recorded 273 million monthly average users in the quarter, up from 249 million in the fourth quarter.

The 27-nation EU economy is predicted to contract by 7.5 percent this year, before growing by about 6 percent in 2021. The group of 19 nations using the euro as their currency will see a record decline of 7.75 percent this year, and grow by 6.25 percent in 2021, the European Commission said in its Spring economic forecast. \"Europe is experiencing an economic shock without precedent since the Great Depression,\" EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said in a statement. Infection slowing More than 1.1 million people have contracted the virus across Europe and over 137,000 have died, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Unclear outbreak data, low testing rates and the strain on health care systems mean the true scale of the pandemic is much greater. With the spread slowing in most European countries, people are cautiously venturing out from confinement and gradually returning to work, but strict health measures remain in place amid concern of a second wave of outbreaks and any return to something like a normal life is at least months away. The pandemic has hurt consumer spending, industrial output, investment, trade, capital flows and supply chains. It has also hit jobs.

Remdesivir, a drug developed by Gilead Sciences, has grabbed attention as one of the most promising treatments for Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 250,000 people. US drug authorities granted emergency use authorisation last week, paving the way for its broader use in US hospitals, after Gilead provided data showing the drug had helped Covid-19 patients. The company plans to price the drug, which is given via intravenous infusion, at between 5,000 and 6,000 takas per vial ($59-$71/per vial), Beximco's Chief Operating Officer Rabbur Reza told Reuters, adding a patient might need anywhere between 5 and 11 vials. \"We will only know exactly how much a patient needs once studies are complete,\" Reza said. \"We do expect the Bangladesh government will try to cover some of the price of the drug.\" Production will begin this month, initially for domestic use, Reza added. Beximco's pricing indicates a course of remdesivir treatment could cost between $295 and $781 per patient in the south Asian country depending on the severity of the case, the number of vials required and the final pricing of the drug.

Apple and Google, whose operating systems power 99 percent of smart phones, said last month they would work together to create a system for notifying people who have been near others who have tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The companies plan to allow only public health authorities to use the technology. Both companies said privacy and preventing governments from using the system to compile data on citizens was a primary goal. The system uses Bluetooth signals from phones to detect encounters and does not use or store GPS location data.

The Apple-Google decision to not allow GPS data collection with their contact tracing system will require public health authorities that want to access GPS location to rely on what Apple and Google have described as unstable, battery-draining workarounds. Alternatives likely would miss some encounters because iPhones and Android devices turn off Bluetooth connections after some time for battery-saving and other reasons unless users remember to re-activate them.

For the first time, two Asian countries were among the top three, with China and India spending an estimated $261 billion (up 5.1 percent) and $71.1 billion (up 6.8 percent) respectively. While Chinese expenditure over the past 25 years has closely followed the country's rapid economic expansion, their investments also reflect their ambition of a \"world class military\". \"China has openly stated that they want to essentially compete with the US as a military superpower,\" Tian said.

Conte gave the most detailed outline yet of plans to reopen the economy, in a newspaper interview published on Sunday ahead of the government's road map out of lockdown, which he said would be released no later than early this week. Italy, hit hard by the virus weeks before other major Western countries, has been forced to serve as a model for how to fight it. It is being closely watched around the world as it takes its early steps to chart a path out of a strict lockdown it imposed in early March. Conte described a phased process that would see much of manufacturing restarted in early May, although businesses frequented by the general public such as bars and restaurants would have to wait a bit longer.

The uncertainty amid the novel coronavirus pandemic has caused a surge in the price of gold, reaching more than $1,700 per ounce (33.1 grammes) which at the start of the year hovered around $1,500. Many countries are desperately trying to apply measures that can stem the economic bleeding from the pandemic lockdown, including stimulus packages or bailouts for businesses. Amid the uncertainty, people have started to buy gold to avoid the negative effects of inflation or because they see it as a sound financial investment during a crisis. According to a recent Bank of America Corporation (BofA) report \u2018 The Fed can\u2019t print gold \u2019, the price of one ounce of gold will hit $3,000 in 18 months. This estimate is 56 percent higher than gold\u2019s historic record in September 2011 when the price peaked at $1,921. Analysts in the report said: \u201cAs economic output contracts sharply, fiscal outlays surge, and central bank balance sheets double, fiat currencies could come under pressure.\u201d Taking all these reasons into consideration \u201cinvestors will aim for gold\u201d the report said. On the other hand, BofA expects the price of gold to be at $1,695 on average for this year. For 2021, the average will be $2,063. According to BofA analysts, the demand for jewellery is set to plunge as consumers try to save cash. Weakened purchasing power in India and China will continue to put pressure on the metal even when the global economy has recovered from the pandemic. \u201cBut beyond traditional gold supply and demand fundamentals, financial repression is back on an extraordinary scale,\u201d the report added.

The deep plunge of oil prices and the novel coronavirus pandemic are proving disastrous for the oil-rich Middle Eastern countries. Oil collapsed to less than $16 a barrel on Wednesday, hitting its lowest price since 1999, with the market awash with oversupply as the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic hammers demand for fuel. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects demand will decrease still further, which means that there will be a surplus in oil supply despite the oil-producing countries deciding to lower production. On the other hand, the oil suppliers do not have any place to store their surplus oil, which prompts them to sell their products at low prices. Amidst the double crisis, these oil-producing countries are facing real financial difficulties. Saudi Arabia, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar all depend on oil trade. The Gulf countries, whose economies are heavily relying on oil revenue, have been sounding the alarm in recent years. Many countries in the region have been trying to distribute their incomes to other sectors such as tourism and technology. Despite all these efforts to build non-oil based economies, many reports illustrate the Gulf economies have had major budget deficits in recent years.

The move comes as ties between Washington and Beijing grow more strained, with both sides trading barbs over who is to blame for the spread of the disease and an escalating tit-for-tat over the expulsion of journalists from both countries. Under the proposed rule change, foreign companies that use US chipmaking equipment would be required to obtain a US licence before supplying certain chips to Huawei.

Instead, the government forecast that GDP would fall by eight percent, with the public deficit rising to 10.4 percent of GDP.

Remittances sent home by migrants from low- and middle-income countries are expected to drop around 20 percent this year amid the global economic slowdown caused by the novel coronavirus. the World Bank said Wednesday. Job losses and lost hours and wages are expected to leave migrants in wealthier nations unable to send as much money home to poorer countries already suffering from coronavirus shutdowns, the report says. The flow of remittances to poorer countries in Europe and Central Asia is expected to drop 27.5 percent, followed by sub-Saharan Africa with 23.1 percent, South Asia at 22.1 percent, the Middle East and North Africa at 19.6 percent, Latin America and the Caribbean with 19.3 percent and East Asia and the Pacific with 13 percent. The drop is already dealing a heavy blow to families and entire economies in the developing world. From South Asia to Latin America, relatives of workers who send money from wealthier countries are already reporting difficulty meeting basic daily needs after cuts in remittances. Remittances last year became a larger source of funds for poorer nations than foreign direct investment, Remittances reached a record $554 billion in 2019, a number that may have been ever larger due to the flow of remittances through informal channels like cash carried by hand.

Nearly 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week \u2014 nearly five times the previous record set in 1982 \u2014 amid a widespread economic shutdown caused by the coronavirus. The surge in weekly applications was a stunning reflection of the damage the viral outbreak is inflicting on the economy. Filings for unemployment aid generally reflect the pace of layoffs. Layoffs are sure to accelerate as the US economy sinks into a recession. Revenue has collapsed at restaurants, hotels, movie theaters, gyms, and airlines. Auto sales are plummeting, and car makers have closed factories. Most such employers face loan payments and other fixed costs, so they're cutting jobs to save money. As job losses mount, some economists say the nation's unemployment rate could approach 13 percent by May. By comparison, the highest jobless rate during the Great Recession, which ended in 2009, was 10 percent. \u201cWhat seemed impossible just two weeks ago is now reality,\u201d said Nancy Vanden Houten, an economist at Oxford Economics, a consulting firm. \u201cThe US economy will experience the largest economic contraction on record with the most severe surge in unemployment ever.\u201d The economic deterioration has been swift.

Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said support from governments could drive rapid growth in battery and hydrogen technology to help the world to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. \"I believe there is an opportunity \u2014 and I call it an historic opportunity here,\" Birol, an economist who took the helm of the Paris-based IEA in 2015, told Reuters. \"The big time is about to come, but they need a push,\" he said, adding that the economic stimulus packages being delivered worldwide offer an ideal vehicle for change. After weeks of extraordinary turmoil in oil markets, the IEA \u2014 created to ensure steady energy supplies to industrialised countries after the oil crisis in the early 1970s \u2014 has emerged as a leading proponent of \"green recoveries\" from the pandemic. Birol wants governments to broaden support for well-established paths to reducing carbon emissions, such as embracing greater energy efficiency and expanding renewable energy to create jobs and serve climate goals. But he also wants governments to consider offering promising technologies the kind of subsidy and policy support that have helped to propel spectacular growth in wind and solar power from a low base over the past decade. Global installed solar capacity increased from 40 gigawatts (GW) in 2010 to 580 GW in 2019, according to the Abu Dhabi-based International Renewable Energy Agency. Birol singled out lithium ion batteries and the use of electrolysis to produce hydrogen from water as two technologies poised for rapid take-off. Lithium ion batteries can be used for a wide range of purposes, from powering electric vehicles to storing energy generated by solar or wind plants to ensure a steady supply of electricity at"}

The World Bank is estimating that the coronavirus outbreak will cause economic growth to slow significantly this year in China and other East Asian-Pacific countries, throwing millions into poverty. Under a worst-case scenario, the region could suffer its sharpest downturn since a devastating currency crisis more than two decades ago, the bank said in an updated forecast released Monday. The region faced an unusual combination of \"disruptive and mutually reinforcing events,\" the report said. \"Significant economic pain seems unavoidable in all countries.\" The bank's report projects that growth in the region would slow to 2.1 percent this year from 5.8 percent in 2019 under a \u201cbaseline\u201d forecast in which economic recovery takes hold this summer. But under a worse case, in which the adverse effects of the virus spillover into next year, the region\u2019s economy would contract 0.5 percent, the bank estimates. That would represent the weakest performance for the region since the 1997-98 Asian currency crisis, which plunged 40 percent of the globe into recession. More than 11 million people could fall into poverty in the region under the worst-case scenario, the bank estimates. That's in stark contrast to its earlier forecast that growth would be sufficient this year to lift 35 million people out of poverty. A slowdown of the size being projected by the World Bank for such a critical part of the global economy would have severe effects for the rest of the world. The World Bank said it has not finished forecasts for other parts of the world but last week, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, said it is clear that the global economy has already entered a recession that could be as bad or worse than the slump after the 2008 financial crisis. In the World Bank\u2019s base case, China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, would see growth slow from 6.1 percent last year to 2.3"}

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has urged the European Union to launch a \"recovery bond\" to help fund the response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying failure to tackle the emergency would be a \"tragic mistake\" for the bloc. In an interview with Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore on Saturday, Conte said a common debt instrument was needed to spearhead a European recovery and reinvestment plan to support the economy of the whole area. Using, instead, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to borrow on the market and lend cheaply to governments under some conditionality would not be the right response, he said. \"The ESM is a tool created to help single member states that face financial problems caused by asymmetric shocks,\" Conte said, adding that the virus outbreak was instead causing a shock for whole Europe. \"If Europe does not prove to be up to this historic challenge, the whole European building risks losing, in the eyes of our own citizens, its raison d'etre\". Conte added that, even with the launch of a European recovery bond, each country would continue to remain responsible for its public debt. A summit of EU leaders on Thursday failed to reach an agreement over a joint economic response to the virus and gave euro zone officials two weeks to come up with a way to support the economy during the epidemic.

{"title": "Can John Maynard Keynes once again save the world?", "content": "Governments are spending like never before and many observers are weighing up whether it's the time for Keynesianism to rise from the dead. As governments around the world struggle to fight the economic fallout from the novel coronavirus, there\u2019s an increasing interest in the life and works of the 20th-century economist John Maynard Keynes. For many observers, the stimulus packages of trillions of dollars, the paychecks Americans are getting, and the salaries that Germany is paying on behalf of private companies, are all indicative of a return to Keynesianism. In 1919, after the end of World War I, Keynes, then a Cambridge don of 36 years old, wrote his highly influential book, The Economic Consequences of the Peace, arguing that the allied powers should not extract too many war reparations from Germany, which had lost the war. His argument was simple: Germany owed money to the UK, which owed money to the US, and so on. Too high a burden on one country would ultimately have an impact on another. But more importantly, Keynes has been associated with government spending to spur consumption. \u201cThe old economics was still taught by day. But in the evening, and almost every evening from 1936 on, almost everyone discussed Keynes,\u201d John Kenneth Galbraith wrote in his praise. The Keynesian school of thought favours deficit spending, meaning governments should finance construction of schools, roads, bridges, broadband networks, and hospitals in times of a downturn like the present crisis and not worry about a gaping hole in their budgets. Such an expenditure, which involves printing money, can help revive industries and create jobs. An increase in money supply can lead to inflation in the future but that\u2019s the least of the worries of many policymakers right now. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global financial institution that Keynes helped conceive, says the global economy will contract by at least 3 percent as factories and markets remain shut and people lose jobs.

What's more, governments in countries around the globe are considering extending travel and social lockdown measures that have sapped fuel use in order to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. \"Even if these cuts provide a floor to prices they will not be able to boost prices given the scale of inventory builds we are still staring at,\" Energy Aspects analyst Virendra Chauhan said, referring to storage tanks and ships around the world the are filling up fast amid the slide in demand from end-users. \"The absence of hard commitments from the United States or other G20 members is (a) shortcoming of the deal.\" G20 nations have been urged to help reduce the supply glut, but there was little detail on the outcome of Friday talks between energy ministers from the group and Saudi Arabia.

With rallies cancelled in many countries because of the coronavirus pandemic, unions are instead urging supporters to deck their homes and balconies with banners or take to social media to spread the message. Britain's Trades Union Congress shelved its planned events last month but said \"it was more important than ever to mark the contribution that workers make\", especially as staff in the country's heavily-unionised National Health Service are risking their lives fighting the virus. They have urged people to post a \"short video to social media thanking a worker who's made a difference to you\" with the hashtags #mayday and #ThankAWorker.

{"title": "Will the oil price deal help recover the global economy?", "content": "Celebrations for oil production cuts may have come too soon and will mainly benefit a few rich countries and shareholders. Before we cheer about the \u201chistoric\u201d oil deal, which entails coordinated production cuts to bolster prices, let's look at how this all came about. Over the weekend, US President Donald Trump tweeted that an agreement with Saudi Arabia and Russia had been reached. The price rise is expected to have a far reaching impact on America\u2019s oil-producing states and privately-owned oil companies. \u201cThe big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done,\u201d he tweeted. Saudi Arabia, the leading members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel and Russia, which is the world's second largest oil producer, have agreed to take 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil off the market immediately. Oil producers will keep the lids on additional supplies. A 9.7 million bdp reduction means that around 13 percent of the world\u2019s oil supply has been slashed. The crisis for the oil industry started last month when Riyadh said it was flooding the market with additional supplies. That was an unusual move since major producers were trying to come up with ways to support the price and not crash it - more supply than demand meant a subdued price. It is believed Russia wasn\u2019t agreeing to production cuts because it wanted to hurt US shale oil companies, which have a higher production cost and as a result need a higher price to remain sustainable. But the move backfired for everyone. It coincided with the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, which has created fears that the world economy is facing a slowdown not seen since the 1930s. Trump might be right in saying that he has saved a few thousand jobs in the US oil industry, but more than anything he has tried to rescue powerful shareholders and special interest groups. On Saturday, thirteen US senators representing oil-producing states such as Texas and Alaska had warned Saudi Arabia that the situation could have a fallout on Washington\u2019s relations with the kingdom.

Amazon will begin to put new grocery delivery customers on a wait list and curtail shopping hours at some Whole Foods stores to prioritise orders from existing customers buying food online during the coronavirus outbreak, the company said on Sunday. Many shoppers recently seeking to purchase groceries from the Seattle-based e-commerce company found they could not place orders due to a lack of available delivery slots. Amazon said it would have to relegate all new online grocery customers to a wait list starting Monday while working on adding capacity each week. In recent weeks, it increased the number of Whole Foods stores offering grocery pickup to more than 150 locations, up from 80 previously. Amazon also plans to shorten some Whole Foods stores' hours for the public so its employees can more quickly fulfill online grocery orders, the company said. The moves illustrates how the world's largest online retailer, which showed its ambition to enter the grocery industry by acquiring Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017, is now leveraging its presence both online and in physical stores to handle high demand from consumers who are stuck eating at home, with many restaurant dining rooms closed to the public. Amazon offers grocery delivery services Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime Now from its own warehouses and Whole Foods stores. It typically touts ultra-fast delivery within hours, with shoppers able to choose a delivery window. Last month, Amazon temporarily suspended the Prime Pantry delivery service, which sells non-perishable groceries. Amazon said its online grocery order capacity has increased by more than 60% during the outbreak. Some netizens who said they used Amazon Prime, its $119-a-year subscription service for US shoppers, have nevertheless complained on social media about the scarcity of delivery windows.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected the global economy would shrink by 3 percent in 2020 amid the global coronavirus pandemic, according to a report released on Tuesday. In its latest World Economic Outlook \u2013 released before the annual conference of the IMF and World Bank on Wednesday, the fund downgraded its growth forecast by 6.3 percentage points from its previous report as isolation, lockdowns and widespread closures to contain the virus hit the economy. \"It is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago,\" stressed the report. Growth was forecast to recover next year under the assumption that the pandemic subsides in the second half of 2020 and containment efforts are gradually unwound. The global economy is projected to expand by 5.8 percent in 2021 as economic activity normalises, helped by policy support, according to the report. Pointing to the extreme uncertainty surrounding the global growth forecast, the report underlined that many countries faced a multi-layered crisis comprising of health shocks, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices. The report also highlighted the importance of effective policies to forestall worse outcomes. Though this would take a short-term toll on economic activity, it would be an important investment in long-term human and economic health, it said. Strong multilateral cooperation will be essential to overcome the effects of the pandemic, including to help financially constrained countries facing twin health and funding shocks and for channelling aid to nations with weak health care systems, it noted. The report called on countries to urgently work together to slow the spread of the virus and develop a vaccine and therapies to counter the disease.

The continuing lockdowns and economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic could leave tens of millions of workers jobless in coming months and have an outsized impact on the most impoverished countries if immediate steps aren\u2019t taken, international organisations have warned. Global unemployment, which stands at 190 million, could see a sharp rise as businesses lay off workers and cut working hours. The impact on those working in the informal sector, mostly in the poorest countries, would be worse as they lack social protection such as unemployment benefits. Since lockdowns were enforced, manufacturers of cars, clothes and shoes have seen a sharp drop in demand, which could have a cascading impact on employment rates far beyond these sectors. It could be a vicious cycle that has rattled supply chains, which links the buying habits of a Wall Street banker shopping at Zara with a textile worker living in a congested slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh. While it's still too early to come to a firm figure, the International Labour Organization (ILO), a UN agency, says that more than four out of five people (81 percent) in the global workforce of 3.3 billion are affected by the partial or full workplace closures. Just three weeks ago, it had estimated that around 25 million could lose jobs this year because of the pandemic. But within that time the virus has ripped through the United States, Italy, Spain and many other countries, killing thousands and forcing governments to enforce stricter curfews and limit the movement of people. In the past three weeks, more than 16 million Americans have filed for government support meant for those who have lost their jobs.

Don't 'ignore health protocols' The update came as Iran started reopening \"low-risk\" businesses in a bid to protect its sanctions-hit economy. President Hassan Rouhani urged Iranians to respect health protocols to guard against the new coronavirus as \"low-risk\" economic activities resumed in most of the country. So-called low-risk businesses will resume across the country from Saturday with the exception of the capital Tehran, where they will restart from April 18.

Kuwait Oil Minister Khaled al Fadhel tweeted that, following extensive efforts, \"we announce completing the historical agreement to cut production by nearly 10 million barrel per day by OPEC+ members starting May 1\". Mexico's Energy Minister Rocio Nahle said on Twitter the agreement was for \"an oil reduction of 9.7 million barrels from May.\" Last-ditch effort OPEC producers, dominated by Saudi Arabia, and allies led by Russia, met via video conference for an hour Sunday in a last-ditch effort to cement an accord struck early Friday that hinged on Mexico's agreement.

Sunday's meeting was chaired by Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak. Initially reticence from Mexico to introduce output cuts had led to a standoff that cast doubt on efforts to bolster oil prices, pushed to near two-decade lows by the demand-sapping pandemic and a Saudi-Russia price war that rattled global markets. End of price war? Oil prices have slumped since the beginning of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Islamic finance \u2013 an amalgamation of Sharia law and modern banking \u2013 has become a $2 trillion business over the past two decades, covering everything from bonds to buying cars. But with complex standards set out by a number of Islamic bodies, it's not easy for observant Muslims to decide whether or not an investment is halal (religiously permissible).

The app screens US-listed stocks based on criteria issued by the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions, one of several bodies that set Islamic finance standards. Islamic funds are banned from investing in companies associated with tobacco, alcohol, pork or gambling. Earning interest is also banned as \"usury\".

The World Bank is seeing \"a huge willingness\" on the part of official bilateral creditors to suspend debt payments by the world's poorest countries so they can focus on fighting the coronavirus pandemic, a top Bank official said on Monday. World Bank Managing Director Axel van Trotsenburg said the Group of 20 major economies and the Group of Seven (G7) had been largely supportive of a call by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for a temporary halt in debt payments. \"Everybody understands that we need to help the poorest countries. There is a huge willingness - as in nobody is questioning that, absolutely nobody,\" he told Reuters in an interview. \"I think we are in a good place to move forward.\" Finance officials from the G7 and G20 countries are due to discuss the debt relief issue this week. Three sources familiar with the process said details were still being finalised, but they expected the G20 countries to back a suspension of debt payments at least until the end of the year.

Germany only to 'explore' The ministers, however, set to one side a proposal from Italy, Spain, and France for a joint borrowing instrument, sometimes dubbed a \"coronabond\", that would have raised money towards a recovery after the outbreak. Germany, the EU's most powerful member, has refused the pooled debt proposal and ministers agreed only to \"explore\" the idea under the direction of EU leaders, who are set to meet later in the month.

New software the companies plan to add to phones would make it easier to use Bluetooth wireless technology to track down people who may have been infected by coronavirus carriers. The idea is to help national, state and local governments roll out apps for so-called \u201ccontact tracing\u201d that will run on iPhones and Android phones alike. The technology works by harnessing short-range Bluetooth signals. Using the Apple-Google technology, contact-tracing apps would gather a record of other phones with which they came into close proximity. Such data can be used to alert others who might have been infected by known carriers of the novel coronavirus, typically when the phones' owners have installed the apps and agreed to share data with public-health authorities. Developers have already created such apps in countries including Singapore and China to try to contain the pandemic. In Europe, the Czech Republic says it will release an app after Easter. Britain, Germany and Italy are also developing their own tracing tools. No such apps have yet been announced in the United States, but Gov.

TikTok, which US officials and lawmakers have assailed for potential security risks, said the funds would be for \"front line medical workers, educators, and local communities deeply affected by the global crisis.\" The move follows similar announcements from technology firms including Google, Facebook and Netflix as well as from leaders of Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter. \"We are committed to playing our part in that global outpouring of mutual support and giving,\" TikTok president Alex Zhu said in a statement. \"We want to magnify all we are seeing across our community and translate it into concrete relief for those most affected by this crisis.\" TikTok said $150 million of the funds would be allocated for medical staffing, supplies, and hardship relief for health care workers through the US Centers for Disease Control, World Health Organization, and agencies working to distribute supplies in hard-hit countries including India, Indonesia, Italy and South Korea. Another $40 million will be donated to \"organisations that serve groups representative of TikTok's diverse user communities, including musicians, artists, nurses, educators, and families that have come together on our platform,\" Zhu said. TikTok said it would match $10 million in donations to its \"community relief fund,\" with some of that going to artists, songwriters, and music professionals hurt by cancelled performances and gig work. Another $50 million will be applied to a \"creative learning fund\" to support distance learning efforts worldwide. TikTok, popular with teens for its short music videos, has become one of the most widely used social platforms in recent months and has seen interest surge during the pandemic. The application, owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, saw 65 million worldwide downloads in March, according to analytics site SensorTower.

A Huawei Technologies Co Ltd executive on Tuesday described as \u201cunfortunate\u201d plans by the US government to curb the Chinese telecom equipment maker\u2019s access to global chip supplies. Reuters reported last month that senior Trump administration officials agreed to new measures to force foreign chip manufacturers that use US equipment to seek a license before shipping to the blacklisted company. Sources said the plan, if finalised, could deal a blow to Huawei and one of its key chip manufacturers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. It could also hit US companies like KLA Corp, Lam Research Corp and Applied Materials Inc , which provide chipmaking equipment. Speaking on a webinar, Paul Scanlan, chief technology officer of Huawei\u2019s networking business, lamented the news, but appeared to dismiss concerns that the measures could hurt the company in the long run. \u201cRelating to things like the US government curtailing exports of chips to Huawei and things like this, and the other components, that is really unfortunate that the world has to go down this route,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we spend $20 billion on (research and development) and that is probably ... why we make a lot of money.\u201d Last month, Huawei reported its weakest annual profit growth in three years for 2019 and predicted the Chinese government would retaliate against new US trade restrictions."}

Finance ministers from the 19 countries that use the euro haggled into the night for 16 hours by videoconference starting on Tuesday. The meeting ended without a deal and will resume on Thursday. European governments are scrambling to put together hundreds of billions of euros to save lives as well as companies and families from going bankrupt. Many countries hit hardest by the virus are also those that can least afford the costs, like Italy and Spain. But they are divided over how best to tackle the challenge. Italy and Spain, backed by France, want to throw all the EU\u2019s economic might into fighting the virus and damage from the disruption it has caused as soon as possible. The deadlock recalls the divisions from the eurozone debt crisis of 2010-2015. On the table is a three-part package amounting to around $550 billion. It consists of up to $260 billion in emergency loans from the eurozone's standing bailout fund, credit guarantees from the European Investment Bank to keep companies afloat, and support for short-work schemes that help companies avoid layoffs during what is hoped are temporary business interruptions. Italy rejects bailout fund Italy has rejected using the bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. One reason is that the money is supposed to come with conditions to carry out economic reforms, based on the fund's original purpose as a bailout refuge for troubled countries. Italy argues that makes the ESM the wrong tool since the virus is no country's fault. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has dismissed the bailout fund as \u201ctotally inadequate.\u201d Germany has proposed waiving most conditions on the money,"}

For decades constant economic growth has been considered a requisite indicator of economic health globally. The outbreak of the Covid-19 virus has forced many countries to accept that they are in the midst of a global downturn, which may reach the proportions set by the 2008 crisis . In China, officials were quick to realise that they could not balance economic growth with containment of the coronavirus. The epidemic has killed more than 3,200 people there so far. \u201cChina has just shown itself to be very, very willing to sacrifice their economy to prevent a resurgence in infections,\u201d said Emily Fend, NPR\u2019s China correspondent. Beijing has locked down much of the country to stop the spread of the disease and has reported no new cases for the last two days. But China was in a state of denial at the start of the pandemic, detaining whistleblower doctor, Li Wenliang , who dared to report that the then unknown virus, later named as Covid-19, could spread out of proportions across the country. Out of fears that Wenliang\u2019s warning shots could hit China\u2019s economic growth narrative, Beijing accused the doctor, who later passed away from the virus infection of \u201cspreading false rumours\u201d. China is not alone in its early denialism with both British and American governments acting slowly amid the threat. US President Donald Trump, for example, dismissed the virus as less than \u201ca seasonal flu\u201d. \u201cSo last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu.

A pandemic forcing everyone to stay home could be the perfect moment for online grocery services. In practice, they've been struggling to keep up with a surge in orders, highlighting their limited ability to respond to an unprecedented onslaught of demand. After panic buying left store shelves stripped of staples like pasta, canned goods and toilet paper, many shoppers quickly found online grocery delivery slots almost impossible to come by, too. \u201cIt's kind of becoming more challenging to put a meal together,\u201d said Paul Smyth, a software engineer who lives near Manchester, England, where the online groceries industry is particularly advanced. He's a longtime customer of British online-only supermarket Ocado but hasn't been able to land a slot since he received his last delivery two weeks ago. The problem for many delivery services is ramping up staff to pick goods in shops and deliver. But for Ocado, a cutting edge service that relies on warehouse robots, significantly increasing deliveries would mean a big investment in new machinery and warehouses too late to catch the spike in demand. Smyth said he's starting to run low on meat and frozen goods, but wants to avoid going to a supermarket because he worries his asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure are risk factors if he catches the new coronavirus. \u201cI won't be panicking for another week, but if I've got to wait another two weeks for a delivery slot it's going to be very close to the bone.\" The coronavirus crisis is giving the e-commerce industry a boost but troubles at Ocado and other online grocers highlight how hard it is for the industry to quickly scale up online delivery.

While the deadly disease continues to sweep across the planet, signs that the rate of infections is possibly levelling out and countries preparing to ease some lockdown restrictions have instilled a semblance of optimism this week. \"Signs that the number of new daily coronavirus cases is topping out in Western Europe... is driving expectations that social distancing measures will be lifted soon,\" said Stephen Innes, at AxiCorp. \"Relaxing of social distancing rules is providing the undercurrent of positivity in the markets.\" However, uncertainty about how long the crisis will last and the damage it will inflict on the global economy was keeping traders on edge and hobbling any sustainable rally.

Around 25 million people risk losing their jobs as airlines, shopping malls, hotels, and restaurants among many other businesses take a hit from the Covid-19 pandemic, says the United Nations. People in dozens of countries are staying indoors as health experts have cautioned that the best way to fight the disease is to avoid public gatherings and keep social distance. That has cut spending and sales, creating a cascading effect across supply chains. But mandatory shutdowns of businesses in some cities have raised concerns that many people will lose their jobs as employers don\u2019t have the capacity or willingness to pay salaries regardless of making any sales or profits. This has prompted governments to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into financial markets to keep the global economy afloat. Europe The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced it will spend more than $818 billion to buy bonds from the public and private sectors. The measure dubbed the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme is aimed at helping stabilise markets and regaining confidence in the euro market. The ECB took the steps at a time when investors were penalising some European countries such as Italy by demanding higher returns against lending them money. Italy is, in particular, facing economic distress as it struggles to contain the pandemic, which has killed around 3,000 people there. The ECB had initially suggested that it wouldn\u2019t intervene to help cash-strapped members even as the United States took steps to ease market turmoil with additional funding.

The decisions we make today will be remembered for years.\" He called for \"more ambition, more unity and more courage\" from the EU, in response to a letter from von der Leyen in the same paper on Thursday where she had promised more support for Italy. Conte wants the whole bloc to share the risk by issuing billions of euros in so-called coronabonds, helping Italy to borrow more cheaply to fight a pandemic that has killed nearly 14,000 people and shattered the country's economy. Von der Leyen has sided with Germany and some other northern European countries, who argue that pooled risk could raise their borrowing costs.

Wall Street rallied on Thursday for its first gain in three days after a sudden surge in oil prices revived beaten-down energy stocks. But, as has so often been the case in this year's volatile market, it took a few U-turns to get there. The price of crude spurted as much as 30 percent higher after President Donald Trump said he expects Russia and Saudi Arabia to back away from their price war, which erupted last month and helped drag US oil to its lowest price in 18 years. The surge lifted energy stocks enough to pull the S&P 500 higher and outshine another dismal report showing that millions of Americans are joining the unemployment queue by the week. But stocks and oil quickly pared much of their initial gains and then see-sawed through the day as markets weighed how seriously to take Trump\u2019s statement, particularly after the Kremlin reportedly disputed part of his tweet, before climbing again to the close.

India's income tax revenues contracted 3.5 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, which began in April 2019, and income from other taxes grew by a meagre 3.8 percent, the finance ministry told parliament on Monday. The food ministry had proposed lowering import taxes on crude and refined vegetable oils, including palm oil, by 3-7 percent to keep a lid on domestic prices that leapt more than 11 percent after India restricted palm oil imports from Malaysia in January. But the finance ministry rejected that proposal due to revenue concerns, the sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. India had been the biggest buyer of Malaysian palm oil for five years, but purchases ground to a halt after the January curbs, a retaliation for then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad's criticism of New Delhi's policy regarding its Muslim minority.

London and Frankfurt opened more than 4 percent higher and Shanghai, Hong Kong and other Asian markets advanced. Seoul surged 7.4 percent. Investors were encouraged after seeing more steps by the Federal Reserve and other central banks and governments to support credit markets and the economy. On Wall Street, the future for the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 2.8 percent and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 3.2 percent. The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent on Thursday in a relatively modest change after wild price swings over the past week. Hopes are rising that there will be progress in finding virus treatments and that \u201ca boatload of stimulus by both central banks and governments will put the global economy in position for a U-shaped recovery\u201d, said Edward Moya of Oanda in a report. On Thursday, the European Central Bank launched a program to inject money into credit markets by purchasing up to $820 billion in bonds. The Bank of England cut its key interest rate to a record low of 0.1 percent. Australia's central bank also cut its benchmark lending rate to 0.25 percent. Central banks in Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines also cut their benchmark rates. They are trying to reduce the impact of a global recession that forecasters say looks increasingly likely as the US and other governments tighten travel controls, close businesses and tell consumers and travellers to stay home. Investors also appeared to be encouraged by reports that China is set to ramp up stimulus spending after the province in which the virus emerged in December showed no new infections on Wednesday.

Spain has shed close to 900,000 jobs, more than half of them temporary, since it went into lockdown in mid-March to fight the coronavirus outbreak, social security data showed on Thursday. Spain, which has the world's second-highest death toll from the disease after Italy, has banned all but essential outings since March 14. This week, it further tightened the lockdown with a ban on all but essential workers leaving home to go to work. The data showed 898,822 Spaniards have now lost their jobs since the start of the lockdown, including around 550,000 temporary workers. The number of people officially registered as unemployed in Spain rose to 3.5 million in March, the highest level since April 2017. That data does not include all the new job losses, as not all workers officially registered as unemployed. Neither the social security nor the unemployment data include the so-called \"ERTE\" temporary layoffs, under which companies that face financial difficulties can temporarily suspend a worker's contract. Many companies, including car plants and other major businesses, have implemented such temporary layoff measures over the past weeks. 'Double challenge' \"It is always a big problem and it is the double challenge we have: to fight the epidemic and to avoid the economic activity being swept away. We will have to work on relaunching the economy once we can get control of the epidemic,\" Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos told RNE radio. March is usually a good month for employment in Spain because it marks the start of the holiday season, with many temporary workers finding jobs in particular in the hospitality sector. However, hotels, restaurants and bars are currently shut because of the lockdown."}

More than 50 African countries have asked for immediate $100 billion funding from foreign donors to help mitigate the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic that could cost millions of people to lose their jobs. The appeal was made on Tuesday in an online meeting between finance ministers of the 54 nations that are part of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), a regional agency of the United Nations. For the second time in two weeks, some of Africa\u2019s most indebted countries have asked for immediate financial support. The ministers noted that since March 19, when the first call was made, the number of cases and deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has surged substantially. In just 12 days, the number of infected people rose from 633 in 35 countries to 5,318 in 46 countries. More than 175 people have lost their lives with most of the cases being reported from Algeria, Egypt and South Africa. Many African countries, already struggling with poverty and militancy, don\u2019t have additional resources to spend on equipping hospitals to deal with the expected increase in the number of patients who require ventilators and ICUs as seen in Italy and Spain. The average stimulus package announced by African countries was equivalent to 0.8 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP), or one-tenth the average level of the stimulus of developed countries, which stood at 8 percent of their GDP and trillions of dollars. More than one-third of the $100 billion in funding that Africa wants will be spent on servicing the debt of the developing countries. This year, the continent is expected to pay $44 billion in interest payments to creditors, which include the IMF, World Bank, wealthy countries including China, and private investors. The IMF and World Bank have also issued appeals for debt moratoriums and asked wealthy countries to stop collecting them.

The result far surpassed even the highest of estimates by economists, and reflected the growing damage to the US economy as the pandemic worsens and the growing death toll prompts more states to impose lockdowns. Bustling cities have been turned into ghost towns, as Covid-19 restrictions have forced shops, restaurants and offices to close, leaving grocery stores and hospitals the lone epicenters of activity.

European leaders are bickering over who would foot the bill for the funds that need to be raised to provide much-needed resources to overworked hospitals and benefits to those who have lost their jobs. At the heart of the issue is the indifference of the financially prosperous northern European nations of Germany, Netherlands and Austria towards the plight of their southern neighbours. Italy, Spain, France, and others want to issue so-called corona bonds, which is essentially a debt that can be collectively guaranteed by the block. This makes sense for countries such as Italy, which has to pay high interest rates if it borrows money on its own because of its high debt and concerns over its ability to pay. \u201cThe image that Italians have of the Netherlands has been drastically polluted in just a few days,\u201d former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta told Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant . \u201cAnd not just in Italy \u2026 Look at the reactions in Portugal and Spain.

Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday, on continuing worries about the economic fallout from the pandemic as reports of coronavirus cases keep surging in various regions. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 1.7 percent in morning trading to 18,588.90. Adding to the damage was the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment called \u201ctankan,\u201d which highlighted the gloom over a likely recession. The world's third-largest economy had already been lagging for months when the outbreak began taking its toll earlier this year. Sentiment among Japan's large manufacturers fell in the January-March period, marking the fifth straight quarter of decline, according to the central bank. The tankan measures corporate sentiment by subtracting the number of companies saying business conditions are negative from those responding they are positive. The key index, which measures sentiment among large manufacturers, fell to minus 8 from zero in October-December, the worst result in seven years. Sentiment among non-manufacturers was also dismal as the service sector, tourism and other businesses have also been hit hard by the outbreak. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 3 percent to 5,229.40, while South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.5 percent to 1,745.17.

World stock markets had capitulated on what has become known as \"Black Monday\", with the Dow Jones Index in the US losing more than 2,000 points, and the crash even triggering the emergency break in early trade amid panic selling. But there was some relief on Tuesday as oil prices jumped around six percent after plunging by a third the previous day, in their worst session since the 1991 Gulf War. Japan's main Nikkei index opened three percent lower following the dizzying falls on Wall Street but later pared back losses by more than half. An hour and a half into trade, the Nikkei stood at 19,622.05 points, a loss of 0.4 percent compared to the previous day. The Nikkei was helped by a sell-off in the yen, which is normally heavily bought during times of market uncertainty. A weaker yen is positive for exporters on the Japanese market and usually boosts their share prices. The market in Seoul was down 0.4 percent and the ASX in Australia pared losses to around one percent after opening lower by nearly four percent.

The words \"bear market\" and \"recession\" are being used with increasing frequency as investors try to assess how badly the coronavirus outbreak will damage global growth and to what extent it could further weigh on asset prices. The accelerating outbreak has stoked violent swings in markets around the world. Many investors say there is little clarity on what trajectory the virus will take and how effective government measures will be, making it difficult to gauge how much economic damage has already been baked into asset markets. Rabobank in a note earlier this week said the initial strategy in most Western countries, which was to do nothing and tell people all is well, was not effective. As the virus has spread in the United States, investors have become increasingly worried about a number of factors, including what some have called an uneven government response, confusion about the number of cases in the country and concerns that fear of contracting the virus or government-imposed limits on movement will hit consumer spending and damage the economy. \"The market has not caught up to the facts.

In the history of global economic crises, the job of building confidence in currencies, financial institutions and markets has almost always fallen upon the shoulders of central bankers. At times they have made wrong decisions, which have dried up credit, shut factories and left millions of people jobless. The years that led to the Great Depression of 1929, saw four men play an outsized role in the events that followed: Montagu Norman at the Bank of England, Benjamin Strong at the US Federal Reserve, Hjalmar Schacht in Germany and France\u2019s Emile Moreau were powerbrokers in the world of finance after the First World War. Germany was obliged to pay war reparations and similarly, the UK and France also owed money to creditors after the devastating war. \u201cThe quartet of central bankers did in fact succeed in keeping the world economy going but they were only able to do so by holding interest rates down and by keeping Germany afloat on borrowed money,\u201d writes Liaquat Ahamed, in his book Lords of Finance. \u201cIt was a system that was bound to come to a crashing end.\u201d That was a different time and the reasons that led to the crash in stock and bond prices in the 1930s were distinct from what we see today.

American auto manufacturers General Motors and Ford, French car companies PSA and Renault, Germany's Volkswagen group and Formula 1 engineers have joined the ranks in response to a massive global shortage of the vital piece of medical equipment. As hospitals around the world face a surge of patients with breathing difficulties from Covid-19, the scarcity of ventilators has forced doctors to make life-or-death decisions. Repurposing car factories for emergency production has drawn comparisons to World War II, when they were used to build tanks and fighter planes. But some experts say that in this situation, building critical care ventilators will require different techniques and procedures from what a car factory normally sees. Wartime economy? US President Donald Trump used wartime economy analogies to justify his appeal to the automobile industry as the country grapples with a mounting number of coronavirus cases.

Flybe was already facing financial issues and was on life support in the shape of government assistance in the UK. But it has clearly suffered from the drop in passenger traffic just as airlines around the world are experiencing. From the German carrier Lufthansa to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, many are struggling to fill seats as people avoid travelling, especially to cities where the Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, cases are on the rise.

Running an airline is a tough business. Surges in fuel price quickly erode profit margins. Aircraft are often leased or bought on loans, which means they have to be continuously operated to pay off the charges. In many countries, airline staff are unionised with the pilots and engineers enjoying good perks. Retrenchment to cut back costs can be a challenge in times of crisis.

The coronavirus epidemic could cost passenger airlines up to $113 billion in lost revenue this year, an industry body warned on Thursday, more than three times a projection it made just two weeks ago as the virus continues to spread around the world. Airlines across the world are rushing to cut flights and costs and are warning of a hit to earnings as the new virus, which started in China, spreads, raising fears of a pandemic that could plunge the global economy into recession. In a sign of the difficulties this is creating for airlines, a Turkish Airlines jet was flown back to Istanbul without any passengers on board on Thursday on orders from Singapore after a passenger who had arrived on the same plane on Tuesday tested positive for the virus. IATA projected the hit to passenger airlines in lost revenue from the crisis could be anywhere between $63 billion and $113 billion this year, depending on the virus's progression. On February 20, it had forecast a hit of $29 billion. Global airline industry revenues totalled $838 billion in 2019, according to IATA data. The Covid-19 virus has killed more than 3,000 people and infected tens of thousands more, mostly in China. But the disease has now spread to more than 60 other countries, leading to multiple travel and other restrictions. Among the latest events to be cancelled is the world air traffic management congress in Madrid, which had been scheduled for March 10 to 12. 'Inevitable' The failure of British regional airline Flybe comes less than two months after a rescue deal for the company was agreed upon by its owners and the UK government.

Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei is confident some European telecoms firms will choose it to provide 5G technology for their core networks, the firm\u2019s chief representative to the EU, Abraham Liu, told Reuters on Friday. Shenzhen-based Huawei is at the centre of a spat between China and the US with the latter saying the company\u2019s 5G technology could be used as a backdoor spy channel for Beijing. Huawei has denied the claims and countered the charges by saying the US itself has a long track record of modifying digital products to collect intelligence.

The European Union in January unveiled new 5G guidelines for member states, in which it allowed individual countries to decide what part Huawei could play in their networks. Britain recently granted Huawei a limited role in its 5G mobile network by ruling it would be allowed into the non-sensitive parts of the network.

World Bank President David Malpass said there were still \"many unknowns\" about the fast-spreading virus and \"much more\" aid might be required, but he declined to elaborate. Malpass called on countries to coordinate their actions on a regional and international level, saying the speed and breadth of the response would be critical to saving lives. \"We're announcing today an initial package of immediate support that will make available up to $12 billion to respond to country requests for crisis financing of their immediate needs and also to lessen the tragic impacts of the crisis,\" he said. \"The point is to move fast; speed is needed to save lives,\" Malpass said during a teleconference with reporters. \"There are scenarios where much more resources may be required.

Pakistan's farmers are struggling to combat the worst locust plague in nearly three decades as insect swarms decimate entire harvests in the country's agricultural heartlands and send food prices soaring. Heavy rains and cyclones sparked \"unprecedented\" breeding and the explosive growth of locust populations on the Arabian peninsula early last year, according to the UN. The insects have since fanned out and wreaked havoc on farms from East Africa to India before making their way into Pakistan from the desert on the country's southwestern border with Iran. The crisis is so severe that the government has declared a nationwide emergency and urgently appealed for help from the international community. Officials in southern Sindh province fear the infestation will devastate the supply of cotton, the local cash crop, ahead of its harvest in the coming months. Local surveys of the damage are continuing, but the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture says nearly half of all crops have been destroyed near the port city of Karachi. \"I have not seen an infestation like this one in my career,\" said Shehbaz Akhtar, an agricultural official charged with locust eradication efforts in the village of Pipli Pahar in central Punjab province. 'Combat operation' Local authorities had \"launched a combat operation\" to clear the area of infestation with pesticide sprays, he said.

The order was postponed to allow for the \"study of its impact on the national currency, banking transactions as well as on the money of savers and economic security\", Ghassan Oueidat said Thursday according to a statement carried by the National News Agency. \"Such a measure would likely drag the country and its financial sector into chaos.\" Lebanon has been gripped by mass protests against the political class and banking sector even as it suffers its worst economic crisis in decades. Banks have imposed increasingly tight limits on dollar withdrawals and transfers abroad as part of measures to tackle a severe liquidity crisis. But bankers stand accused of having sent millions of dollars abroad despite those limitations. On Monday the prosecutor separately called in 15 banks over more than $2 billion in capital flight despite the restrictions in the two months after the start of the protests. The value of the Lebanese pound has plummeted on the black market, prices have risen, and many businesses have been forced to slash salaries, dismiss staff or close.

Global insurers face a hefty bill if the coronavirus forces the cancellation of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, with estimates of the cost of insuring the sporting showpiece running into billions of dollars. Japan has more than 200 cases of coronavirus, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and killed around 2,800, mostly in China. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has ordered numerous sporting events cancelled as it tries to contain the epidemic but has pledged the Olympics, in which Japan has invested some $12 billion, will go ahead as planned from July 24. But fears persist that the Games may be postponed, moved or even called off, a decision International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Dick Pound was reported this week as saying would need to be taken by May. Potential losses from cancelling an event will generally be higher the later a decision is made, said Adrian Thomas, a director at insurance broker Aon. \"If they have to cancel 2-3 weeks before the event start-date, they have spent everything they have to spend. If you have three months to go before the event start-date, they have an opportunity to save some event costs,\" Thomas said. IOC President Thomas Bach said on Thursday the Committee is \"fully committed\" to the Tokyo Games. The IOC takes out around $800 million of protection for each Summer Games, which covers most of the roughly $1 billion investment it makes in each host city. Insurance sources estimated it would pay a premium of about 2-3 percent, giving a bill of up to $24 million to insure the Tokyo event.

Lebanon said on Saturday it would default on its Eurobond debt for the first time and seek out restructuring agreements amid a spiralling financial crisis that has hit foreign currency reserves. But Prime Minister Hassan Diab said that foreign currency reserves have fallen to \"a worrying and dangerous level which pushes the Lebanese government to suspend payment of the March 9 Eurobond maturity because of a need for these funds.\" \"The Lebanese state will seek to restructure its debts, in a manner consistent with the national interest, by entering into fair negotiations ... with all creditors,\" he said in a live address. Lebanon's debt burden, long among the largest in the world, is now equivalent to nearly 170 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP). Despite a series of crises, the country has never before defaulted, but in recent months it has grappled with its worst economic turmoil since the 1975-1990 civil war. Foreign currency inflows have slowed, Lebanon's pound has plunged in value and banks have imposed tough restrictions on dollar withdrawals and transfers. Debt restructuring Local banks, which own a chunk of the Eurobonds maturing on March 9, had argued against a default, saying it would pile added pressure on a cash-strapped banking sector and compromise Lebanon's ties with foreign creditors. According to Marwan Barakat, head of research at Bank Audi, Lebanese banks owned $12.7 billion of the country's outstanding $30 billion Eurobonds as of the end of January. The central bank held $5.7 billion and the remainder was owned by foreign creditors, he said. According to local media reports, Lebanese banks have recently sold a chunk of their Eurobonds to foreign lenders.

The preliminary proposed class-action settlement was disclosed on Friday night and requires approval by US District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California. It calls for Apple to pay consumers $25 per iPhone, which may be adjusted up or down depending on how many iPhones are eligible, with a minimum total payout of $310 million.

The Swiss government has filed a criminal complaint over the US Central Intelligence Agency's alleged use of a cryptography company as a front to spy on various governments' secret communications, the Swiss attorney general's office said on Sunday. The complaint against persons unknown for alleged breaches of the law governing export controls follows recent reports on \"Operation Rubicon\", which for decades involved the CIA and German BND spy services covertly reading other nations' secret messages encoded with technology sold by Swiss firm Crypto AG. The case of Crypto, which sold encryption devices and software while being secretly owned by US and German intelligence services that could freely read what it encrypted, is embarrassing for neutral Switzerland and could hurt its international reputation, particularly if it turned a blind eye. Although the outlines of Operation Rubicon were known for years, new details about its scope and duration were made public last month by Swiss, German and US investigative journalists. \"The Office of the Attorney General confirms it has received a criminal complaint by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) dated Feb. 2, 2020 regarding possible violations of export control law,\" the attorney general's office said in a statement.

Saudi Arabia has banned the entry of foreign pilgrims into the country as the world tries to contain the global outbreak of the coronavirus. The decision comes as the illness establishes a foothold in Europe and the Middle East, with Italy and Iran in particular affected. While Riyadh has issued no information about how long the ban will last, a global pandemic could impact pilgrimages during Ramadan, which is only a couple of months away, and the Hajj pilgrimage that follows soon after. The ban applies to the Islam\u2019s holiest city of Mecca and also its second holiest city of Medina. While the overwhelming majority of Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth comes from its fossil fuel deposits, pilgrimages by Muslims are also a significant contributor to its economy. The kingdom relies on oil revenues for 87 percent of its budget, and oil related industries account for 42 percent of its GDP. Together the Hajj and the Umrah add $12 billion to Saudi Arabia\u2019s GDP per year, which accounts for 20 percent of the country\u2019s non-oil GDP and seven percent of total GDP. In the Hijri year of 1439, which was between 2017-2018, more than 6.7 million Muslims visited the country for the Umrah. The Saudi government has ambitious plans to increase revenues from pilgrimage to $150 billion by 2022 . It hopes that well off visitors will be willing to pay thousands of dollars per night to stay in recently constructed hotels\u2019 suites, which include views of the Kaaba. About 43 percent of Umrah prayers visit Saudi Arabia in the Islamic months of Rajab, Shaban and Ramadan, which makes these three months the most popular time for pilgrimages outside of the Hajj. The Saudi decision to suspend entry for foreign pilgrims coincides with the Islamic date of Rajab 3. Besides the direct monetary benefit that pilgrims bring, more than half a million people are employed in the tourism industry in Saudi Arabia, which is overwhelmingly religiously oriented."}

Britain's Court of Appeal on Thursday ruled in favour of green campaigners who oppose a third runway at London's Heathrow airport, Europe's busiest. The court said the UK government that had given the Heathrow extension the green light in 2018 had failed to take into account the Paris Agreement to limit climate warming. The government will have to go back to the drawing board and amend the policy. The judge said that the government had not sought permission to appeal the ruling in the supreme court, meaning that it could now either rework the policy or choose to scrap the project. \"The government when it published the ANPS (Airports National Policy Statement) had not taken into account its own firm policy commitments on climate change under the Paris agreement.

The plan to build a third runway at Heathrow was approved by the government in 2018, but there has been a change of administration since then, and current Prime Minister Boris Johnson has historically been opposed to expanding the airport.

Hyundai's hydrogen-powered 18-tonne trucks are set to hit the roads in Switzerland next month as the South Korean automaker looks to establish a case for its zero-emissions technology in a low carbon world. Invented nearly two centuries ago, hydrogen fuel cells first lost out to combustion engines and now trail electric batteries in the push for greener transport because they are expensive, hydrogen is hard to store, and most of it is extracted from natural gas in a process that produces carbon emissions. But when it comes to trucks, Hyundai and its partners argue that electric batteries won't always do the job because the bigger the payload, the bigger - and heavier - the battery, and that's a problem for crawling up Swiss mountains. And with more than half of Switzerland's energy coming from hydropower, the country has the potential to extract \"green\" hydrogen from water with electrolysis, an energy-intensive but carbon-free process if powered by renewable electricity. \"It is not enough to produce a truck. You have to take care of the entire ecosystem, find like-minded partners and show this all makes sense for the customer,\" said Mark Freymueller, chief executive of Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility (HHM). \"It is possible to do this with a holistic approach and the right mindset,\" he told Reuters. To be sure, Switzerland's green hydrogen is far more expensive than diesel now but Hyundai hopes that as governments clamp down on carbon emissions and the cost of producing the clean fuel drops, the numbers could start to add up. McKinsey & Co said in study in January that the cost of hydrogen made with renewable energy could drop to $2/kg by 2030 from $3-$5 now - achieving cost parity with diesel for heavy vehicles, once the relative efficiency of the power sources and the lifetime costs of a truck are factored in.

Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp has amassed a stake in Twitter Inc and is pushing for changes, including removal of the social media company's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Twitter is one of the few US technology companies headed, but not controlled, by one of its founders. It has given shareholders equal voting rights, making Dorsey, who owns only about 2 percent of the company, vulnerable to a challenge from an activist investor such as Elliott. Twitter shares fell last year when the company disclosed that its platform experienced glitches that hindered its ability to target ads and share data with partners. The San Francisco-based company's reluctance to expand beyond its core platform has also left it with limited scale compared to its larger social media peers. Elliott, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, will be seeking to install its own nominees to Twitter's eight-member board when three of the company's directors stand for election at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, the sources said. It is not clear who Elliott would like Dorsey replaced with and how big its stake in Twitter is.

After first appearing in Wuhan, China last December, the infection has spread to at least 175 countries and territories. The number of confirmed cases worldwide has surpassed 472,000 while the death toll is over 21,300 and almost 114,800 have recovered, according to data compiled by the US-based Johns Hopkins University."}

As the whole world is consumed in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, measures like quarantine, lockdown and civil curfew have been imposed to ensure as many people stay at home as possible. The shutdown has had economic implications, but for some sectors it's proving beneficial. Medical suppliers The demand for certain types of medicines and medical devices have soared in the past few weeks. Ventilator machines, drugs like hydroxychloroquine, test kits, face masks, and disinfectants are in huge demand. Many countries, such as Italy and Iran, are in desperate need of medical supplies, in light of their strained healthcare infrastructure due to the pandemic. The Italian government recently contacted a domestic ventilator manufacturer, Bologna-based Siare Engineering International Group, asking it to increase its production by a big margin. The government dispatched 25 army technicians to offer a helping hand to Siare\u2019s production supervisors to manage the expanded production and help assemble machines. The army also has made its personnel available to the company\u2019s suppliers. On the other hand, one of the world\u2019s largest makers of ventilators, Swiss-based Hamilton Medical AG, expects to increase production to about 21,000 ventilators this year, up from 15,000 last year by deploying marketing staff to the production line, among other measures. But with many more orders than it can fulfill, the company faces difficult decisions on where to send them. States are still in search of test kits, face masks and some drugs which were believed to be useful during the treatment of Covid-19. Because of the sudden demand manufacturers and distributors of this sector are working round the clock. Delivery cargo firms As several governments have issued stay-home directives, cargo firms are facing enormous pressure as the demand for food and packet delivery services have soared to disproportionate margins. Truck drivers and deliverers are busy with highly-demanded materials, like food, medicine and key materials such as toilet paper and cleaning materials.

The US Senate passed the nation's largest-ever rescue package late on Wednesday, a $2 trillion lifeline to suffering Americans, depleted hospitals and an economy all ravaged by a rapidly spreading coronavirus crisis. The monster deal thrashed out between Republicans, Democrats and the White House includes cash payments to American taxpayers and several hundred billion dollars in grants and loans to small businesses and core industries. It also buttresses hospitals desperately in need of medical equipment and expands unemployment benefits. The measure cleared the Senate by an overwhelming majority and was headed next to the House of Representatives, which must also pass it before it goes to President Donald Trump for his signature. \u201cThe legislation now before us now is historic because it is meant to match a historic crisis,\" said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \u201cOur health care system is not prepared to care for the sick.

The White House and Senate leaders of both parties struck an agreement late Tuesday on a sweeping $2 trillion measure to aid workers, businesses and a health care system strained by the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak. The agreement came after days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure and still needed to be finalised in detailed legislative language. Top White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway shortly after midnight. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,\u201d Ueland said. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. The final details had proved nettlesome. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidised loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. The package was aimed to combat what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had called \"the most serous threat to Americans' health in over a century and quite likely the greatest risk to America's jobs and prosperity that we've seen since the Great Depression\u201d.

After an initial outbreak in China brought the world\u2019s second largest economy to a virtual halt last month, an ever growing number of countries and territories have reported a spike in infections and deaths in March.

Boeing production will be suspended until further notice after the second shift on Wednesday. On Sunday, the largest US planemaker indefinitely extended the halt of its production operations at its Washington state facilities. On Thursday, Reuters reported that planemakers - including Boeing and Airbus SE - were looking at drastic cuts in wide-body production amid a slump in demand for the industry\u2019s largest jetliners, citing manufacturing and supplier sources. Deliveries of long-range jets like the Boeing 777 or 787 and Airbus A350 or A330 have been hit particularly badly as airlines seek deferrals and many withhold progress payments.

President Donald Trump called for an immediate resolution to the stalemate. \"Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today,\" he said on Twitter. \"The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy.

However, in both scenarios modelled by the AU study \u2013 seen by Reuters and entitled \"Impact of the coronavirus on the Africa economy\" \u2013 GDP will now shrink.

US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would impose tariffs on crude imports if he has to \"protect\" US energy workers from the oil price crash that has been exacerbated by a war between Russia and Saudi Arabia over market share. \"If I have to do tariffs on oil coming from outside or if I have to do something to protect our ... tens of thousands of energy workers and our great companies that produce all these jobs, I'll do whatever I have to do,\" Trump told reporters in a briefing about the coronavirus outbreak. Oil prices have dropped by about two-thirds this year as the pandemic crushes demand and as major producers Russia and Saudi Arabia boost output in a war over market share. The United States in recent years has become the world's biggest oil producer, at times putting its exports in competition with Russia and members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or Opec. As oil prices drop, many heavily leveraged US energy companies face bankruptcies and workers are at risk of layoffs. After meeting with industry executives on Friday, Trump said he was not considering tariffs at the moment, but it was a tool that could be used \"if we're not treated fairly.\" Two major industry groups, the American Petroleum Institute and American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, told Trump in a letter on Wednesday that tariffs on oil imports would jeopardize the domestic refining business as some plants depend on crude from abroad. The United States imported more 1 million barrels per day of oil from Russia and Saudi Arabia combined in 2019, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Trump reiterated on Saturday that Saudi Arabia had told him it had agreed with Russia to jointly reduce output by an unprecedented 10 million barrels per day or more.

Turkish Cargo, a division of Turkey's national flag carrier Turkish Airlines, has planned 155 flights per week for cargo freighters and 60 flights per week for passenger aircraft that are being used for cargo operations, departing from Istanbul in April. According to a statement by Turkish Airlines, Turkish Cargo maintains the air bridge built by Turkish Airlines with its cargo operations. The statement said coronavirus brought the entirety of the travel industry nearly to a halt after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic. It said over half of the passenger flights are cancelled compared to last year\u2019s March, and in countries that hit hard by pandemic such as Italy has seen their flights reduced by 90 percent. Turkish Airlines' controlled flights to 14 metropolises and passenger flights are completely suspended for a short time in Turkey.

Saudi Arabia and Russia are close to a deal on oil output cuts to reduce a global glut, a top Russian oil negotiator said on Monday, but details such as how to share out production curbs remained unclear ahead of talks planned for later this week. \"I think the whole market understands that this deal is important and it will bring lots of stability, so much important stability to the market, and we are very close,\" Kirill Dmitriev, one of Moscow's top oil negotiators who also heads Russian's sovereign wealth fund, told CNBC. Dmitriev was the first to make a public declaration last month about the need for an enlarged supply pact, potentially involving producers outside the Opec+ group. Collapsed deal A supply deal between Open, Russia and other producers, a group known as Opec+, that had propped up oil prices for three years collapsed in March, while the coronavirus hammered demand. Riyadh and Moscow blamed each other for the failure and launched a battle for market share, sending oil prices to their lowest in two decades, which has strained budgets of oil-producing nations and hurt higher-cost producers in the United States. US President Donald Trump said last week he had brokered a deal with Moscow and Riyadh. But initial plans for an Opec+ meeting on Monday were delayed, with two Opec sources saying a video conference would now be held at 1400 GMT on Thursday.

Addressing concerns of the fallout from coronavirus, in an extraordinary meeting on Tuesday the Turkish Central Bank Monetary Policy Committee cut its policy rate from 10.75 to 9.75 percent. The bank underlined that the downside risks of the year-end inflation projection have risen, led by a mild trend in core inflation indicators, a sharp fall in international commodity prices, and the increased disinflationary effects of aggregate demand conditions. \"The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery,\" it said, adding that new data or information may lead it to revise its stance. In a separate statement, the Central Bank announced moves to cushion the virus's likely economic and financial fallout. The moves aim to enhance predictability, secure uninterrupted credit flow to the corporate sector, and boost the cash flow of exporting firms. It will provide banks with as much liquidity as they need through intraday and overnight standing facilities, it said. Liquidity may be injected into the market through repo auctions with maturities up to 91 days when needed, along with one-week repo auctions, the bank said. Central banks such as the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have also taken urgent measures to contain the fallout from coronavirus. It decided to hold conventional, multi-price swap auctions with maturities of one, three and six months, against euros and gold in addition to US dollars. The bank also reduced foreign exchange reserve requirement ratios by 500 basis points for lenders that meet real credit growth conditions. Thus, the lenders will be provided with foreign exchange and gold liquidity of nearly $5.1 billion. Additional liquidity facilities are being offered to lenders to secure uninterrupted credit flow to the corporate sector linked to the amount of credit provided to the real sector."}

The case began in 2012 when one of Apple's independent premium resellers complained about uncompetitive practices that included squeezing off supplies in favour of its own stores. The authority found three areas of anti-competitive behaviour. The first was that Apple and its wholesalers agreed not to compete against one another. Second, independent retailers \"could not without risk undertake promotions or lower prices, which led to an an alignment of retail prices\", said de Silva. \"Finally, Apple abusively exploited the economic dependence of these Premium resellers on it and imposed unfair economic conditions on them that were worse than those for its integrated network of retailers,\" she added."}

Moscow refused to support new deeper cuts, saying the impact from the virus could be much worse than thought, and Riyadh retaliated by opening its taps and pledging to pump record volumes on to the market. Russia has so far said it is not planning to come back to the negotiating table despite feeling the pressure from the extraordinary Saudi moves. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday Russia saw no grounds so far for returning to discussions with its OPEC+ partners and can increase its oil production by a modest 200,000 barrels per day in April. By contrast, Saudi Arabia has pledged to raise output by 2.6 million bpd in April, including from stocks. Fellow Gulf producers like the United Arab Emirates has had to join in the battle for market share and has also announced production increases.

Britain takes US concerns about its use of Huawei equipment seriously but is confident a trade deal with the United States will be among its first after leaving the European Union, its foreign secretary said on Monday. US officials have hinted future trade talks could be affected by Britain's decision last month to grant Huawei a limited role in its 5G mobile network, frustrating a global bid by the United States to exclude the firm from the West's next-generation communications systems. \"We listened and take the concerns of our American friends very seriously,\" Dominic Raab said in response to a question about the issue. \"We are reasonably confident that we can do a free trade agreement (with the US) in that first wave of post-Brexit trade deals,\" Raab added, during a visit to Singapore. \"We have had a good conversation about Huawei and the one thing we all recognise is there has been market failure in terms of high-trust vendors being able to provide telecoms infrastructure.\" Last month, Britain said it would cap at 35 percent the involvement of \"high-risk vendors\", such as Huawei, in the non-sensitive parts of its 5G mobile network. Excluding Huawei altogether would have delayed 5G and cost consumers more, it added. Yet some senior members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have demanded that Huawei must not have a role, a position described on Sunday as a \"kind of witch-hunt\" by China's ambassador to Britain. Britain is in talks with America, Australia, Canada, and others on future technological innovations that could challenge Huawei's dominance in the field, Raab said. \"For 5G, the sooner we can build up our pool of high-trust vendors the less reliant we will be on high-risk vendors,\" he added.

The foldable-glass Galaxy Z Flip, which looks like a large makeup compact folded up and expands to look like most smartphones, features foldable glass and will come in purple, gold and black, executives said in San Francisco. Last year\u2019s Galaxy Fold, a larger unit that folds like a book and was largely panned in its debut, had a plastic screen. The Z Flip phone, starting at $1,380 will be available starting Friday. Galaxy Z users will get free access to Alphabet\u2019s YouTube Premium. Samsung also on Tuesday unveiled three new variants of its Galaxy S smartphone range that boast powerful cameras and fast 5G wireless connectivity. Samsung lost its No1 smartphone position to Apple in the December quarter, according to IDC as cheaper iPhone 11 pricing helped the US firm enjoy its best growth performance since 2015. Globally it also faces stiff competition from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, which was a close third in market share in the fourth quarter, although the Chinese company is caught in a US-China battle over security and technology, especially in 5G. \u201cThere has been no better time for Samsung to increase its market share given Huawei\u2019s current woes and Apple yet to release a 5G iPhone,\u201d said Paolo Pescatore, a London-based analyst at PP Foresight. It moved rear camera lenses of the new Galaxy S20 devices, which compete head-to-head with iPhones, into a squarish black panel, bringing cameras closer to the design of the iPhone 11 series. While the South Korean firm hopes the new foldable handset will help burnish its innovation credentials, consumers will be keen to see whether Samsung has overcome technological challenges and screen glitches that forced it to delay the Galaxy Fold last year."}

President Donald Trump's $4.8 trillion budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 is likely to get a chilly reception from lawmakers on Monday over its proposals to slash spending on foreign aid and social safety net programs. The White House plans to unveil the budget blueprint for the fiscal year starting on October 1 at 0530GMT, but administration officials confirmed key figures from the document over the weekend. Democrats are expected to object to the deep spending cuts on domestic programs, while some Republicans may raise concerns over debt and deficits. The budget calls for a 21 percent cut in foreign aid to $44.1 billion, down from $55.7 billion enacted in fiscal year 2020. It would make savings in outlays to safety net programs including $130 billion in Medicare through drug pricing reforms, $292 billion to food stamp and Medicaid programs by enacting new work requirements for beneficiaries, and $70 billion through a clamp-down on eligibility for federal disability benefits. An administration official said the White House was making the proposals for substantial cuts despite an assumption that Congress, which controls US purse strings, would allocate more money on spending than Trump wants. With forecasts for strong economic growth, the budget predicts some $3.7 trillion in government receipts in the 2021 fiscal year. Last year Trump signed a two-year budget deal with Congress that increased federal spending on defense and several other domestic programs, adding to growing government debt. That legislation authorized $2.75 trillion in new defense and non-defense spending through Sept 30, 2021. Trump's budget is largely a political document. It includes spending on Trump's priorities as he seeks re-election later this year, including $2 billion to fund further construction on a border wall with Mexico, a project that is especially popular with his political base, and funding for an infrastructure bill that is unlikely to be passed by Democrats and Republicans in Congress.

His latest budget, which will be released on Monday, is a blueprint for his spending proposals that is unlikely, again, to be passed, particularly in an election year. Trump will seek to make a 21 percent cut in foreign aid in the proposal, which seeks $44.1 billion in the upcoming fiscal year compared with $55.7 billion enacted in the fiscal year 2020, an administration official said.

The two G20 economies hope to deepen trade currently worth a modest US$12 billion a year, in a region increasingly dominated by China's economic and military might. Addressing Australia's parliament on a landmark state visit, President Joko Widodo cast the two nations as would-be \"Avengers\" \u2013 \"forces of good\" uniting to defeat a \"common enemy\" and shared challenges like protectionism, intolerance and climate change. Widodo said his visit to Australia marked \"a new beginning of a new relationship\" between the two nations. The 58-year-old former furniture manufacturer was sworn in for a second term late last year, promising to reduce widespread poverty as Indonesia becomes one of the world's largest economies. Negotiations over the Australia-Indonesia trade deal began in 2010 and it was ratified by Indonesia's parliament last week, ahead of Widodo's visit. The agreement will eventually see the elimination of all Australian trade tariffs, while 94 percent of Indonesian duties will be gradually eliminated. Greater access to the Australian market is expected to spur Indonesia's automotive and textile industries, and boost exports of timber, electronics and medicinal goods. The pact also includes improved access for Australia's agriculture industry to Indonesia's vast market of 260 million people. Australian universities, health providers and miners will also benefit from easier entry to Southeast Asia's biggest economy. In a joint public appearance with Widodo in Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison outlined a 100-day \"action plan\" for implementation.

The United States should \"think twice\" before giving Malaysia back the money recovered from an anti-kleptocracy probe into state fund 1MDB, former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Friday, as the party accused of graft at 1MDB was back in power. Mahathir, 94, abruptly resigned last month before being replaced by Muhyiddin Yassin, whose coalition includes the former ruling party United Malays National Organisation despite voters rejecting UMNO in the 2018 general election amid a backlash over the multibillion-dollar scandal at 1MDB.

The DoJ, in its biggest-ever anti-kleptocracy case, has recouped about $1 billion from the seizure and sale of assets allegedly bought with 1MDB funds. The DoJ returned nearly $200 million to Malaysia in May, but a second transfer of about $240 million was delayed last month amid uncertainty following Mahathir\u2019s resignation, sources have said.

The Israeli military blocked Palestinian agricultural exports on Sunday in the latest escalation of a months-long trade war that comes amid fears of renewed violence as well. Following Defence Minister Naftali Bennett's instruction, the military said it would not allow the Palestinians to transfer their products through their land crossing to Jordan, the occupied West Bank's only direct export route to the outside world. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority said Israeli forces at checkpoints blocked vegetable shipments that were in their way to export abroad. The Ministry of Agriculture statement said vegetable exports to Israel were worth $88 million last year, comprising 68 percent of the occupied West Bank's overall vegetable exports. The crisis erupted in September when the Palestinians decided to stop importing beef from Israel. The Palestinian Authority claimed most of the 120,000 head of cattle they imported monthly from Israel was itself imported and that they, therefore, preferred to import directly from abroad. The move appeared aimed at reducing the Palestinians' economic dependence on Israel. Shortly after the September announcement, Israeli cattle ranchers saw a drop in their market and pressured Israeli authorities to take action. Bennett retaliated with a ban on Palestinian beef and other products, triggering the Palestinians to expand their boycott, and stop importing Israeli vegetables, fruits, beverages, and mineral water. Trump plan at heart of trade crisis? The Palestinians say their actions are aided at pressuring Israel into revoking its ban, while Israel says normal trade will be restored the moment the Palestinian reverse the cattle ban that started the crisis in the first place. The trade crisis comes amid a surge in violence following the release of President Trump's Mideast plan, which the Palestinians have rejected.

Here's how: The novel coronavirus may have temporarily halted global activity on a mass level as countries take extraordinary measures to halt the pandemic, but has it accidentally helped improve the planet's condition? At least for a while, scientists and climate experts say. Since being first detected in China's Wuhan in November, the pandemic has already had a dramatic impact on the air quality of one of the world's biggest emitters of pollutants. Beijing locked down affected cities, shut down factories, and prevented travel. \"NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) pollution monitoring satellites have detected significant decreases in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over China. There is evidence that the change is at least partly related to the economic slowdown following the outbreak of coronavirus,\" NASA Earth Observatory reported. NASA scientists said the reduction in NO2 \u2014 a dangerous pollutant \u2014 was first apparent near Wuhan city, \"but eventually spread across the country.\" Chinese CO2 emissions fell sharply too, according to Finland's Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, which said the carbon dioxide emissions fell by a quarter, or an estimated 200 million tonnes in the four weeks to March 1. \"The measures to contain coronavirus have resulted in reductions of 15 percent to 40 percent in output across key industrial sectors,\" Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the centre said. \"This is likely to have wiped out a quarter or more of the country's CO2 emissions over the past four weeks.\" The virus has spread to more than 120 countries, killing nearly 4,300 with more than 118,000 confirmed cases. As more nations follow China's measures \u2014 by halting flights and trains, shutting schools and businesses, suspending crowd-pulling sports and cultural activities \u2014 such environmental impacts could show up around the globe.

Wall Street stocks concluded a bruising week on a positive note Friday, rallying as President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency and set the stage for more testing in the United States. A late-afternoon surge enabled the Dow to finish almost 2,000 points higher, or 9.4 percent, at 23,185.62, nearly reversing the losses from Thursday, when the blue-chip index suffered its worst session since 1987. The furious rally at the end showed volatility remains elevated in markets, a trend also apparent in Europe where major bourses gained but finished well below session highs as the World Health Organization targets Europe as the new epicentre of the pandemic. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the continent now had \"more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China\". He described it as a \"tragic milestone\", and warned that it was impossible to say when the virus would peak globally. The overall death toll jumped to more than 5,000 across the planet, including nearly 1,500 in Europe, with total infections topping 140,000 across the planet. After initially being viewed as a China-centered problem, the virus has become a global pandemic, raising fears of a global recession as major economies grind to a halt and professional sports leagues and entertainment events are cancelled. \"In mere weeks, the market has shifted gears from a transitory health scare to a full-blown global recession,\" said AxiCorp market strategist Stephen Innes. \"Global supply chains are no longer just 'disrupted' but are now in the process of shutting down completely,\" he added.

{"title": "Who wins and loses in the Saudi-Russia oil gambit?", "content": "A drop in oil prices is a good sign for consumers, but current economic conditions and the coronavirus pandemic makes it difficult to see who stands to benefit. As if things weren\u2019t already bad enough with the coronavirus pandemic and a slowing global economy, a sharp drop in the price of oil has made things even worse for some countries. The fall in oil prices is the result of a rift between the world\u2019s two leading producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia, and has created uncertainty about the stability in petrostates like Iraq, Iran, Algeria and Nigeria. On the face of it, the equation is simple: oil-producing nations stand to lose while those dependent on imports reap the benefit. But there are a host of other factors, including the domestic economic situation, an already depressed outlook and the still unknown impact of the novel coronavirus that will decide the tangible impact. The price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, has dropped to around $32 per barrel - a decrease of more than half since the start of the year. After failing to reach an agreement with Russia last week on the question of how to stop the slide in oil prices, Riyadh decided to crash the price by offering discounts to customers and jacking up production. That might seem counterintuitive to what it was trying to achieve since cutting prices will reduce Saudi oil revenue and those of other members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Russia is not an OPEC member but being among top three global producers it has been closely working with the group for the last couple of years to fix the price by fixing the level of oil output. Moscow says it is not the right time to cut production when it is clear how badly the demand for fossil fuels will be hit in wake of the coronavirus spread, which has forced some countries to quarantine entire cities and ban international travel. Saudi Arabia and Russia are also trying to inflict losses on shale production, which has helped propel the United States to becoming"}

Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow remains open to cooperation with OPEC to stabilise the oil market. \"I want to say the doors aren't closed,\" Novak told the state-run Rossiya 24 TV channel, hinting at the possibility of further talks. Russia's failure to reach an agreement with the cartel \"does not mean that in the future we can't cooperate with OPEC and non-OPEC countries,\" Novak insisted.

Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, responded by announcing unilateral price cuts. This prompted the oil price to plummet and fuelled huge drops on stock markets Monday. On Tuesday, Saudi oil giant Aramco announced a plan to massively increase oil output despite falling demand during the novel coronavirus outbreak.

During a state dinner in 1973, she said : \u201cLet me tell you something that we Israelis have against Moses.

This month, Israel began exporting natural gas to Egypt. That\u2019s an incredible transformation for a country that was entirely dependent on energy imports just a few years back. Now it produces enough gas to generate half its electricity, run many of its factories and still spare some for export. The discovery of large gas reserves off the coast of Israel in the Mediterranean Sea has shaped Tel Aviv\u2019s diplomatic ties in the region \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 depending on who you ask. However, there\u2019s a general agreement among experts that the Jewish state is using it to redraw alliances. \u201cEver since the gas was discovered, Israel has wanted to use it as an instrument of diplomacy,\u201d Dr Sujata Ashwarya, the author of Israel\u2019s Mediterranean Gas: Domestic Governance , Economic Impact and Strategic Implications , told TRT World .

John Kapoor, the founder of Insys Therapeutics Inc, on Thursday could be sentenced to several years in prison and ordered to forfeit up to $113 million for his role in a bribery and fraud scheme that contributed to the US opioid crisis. US Attorney in Boston Andrew Lelling has asked the court to sentence Kapoor to 15 years in prison and seek more than $113 million from him. US District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs already has sentenced four other former Insys executives, but her punishments have been less than three years in prison on government recommendations of more than 10 years. Kapoor is scheduled to become the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive to be sentenced in a case linked to the opioid crisis. Last year, a federal jury in Boston found Kapoor guilty of racketeering conspiracy in a scheme that involved bribing doctors to prescribe the company's fentanyl-based painkiller, Subsys. The scheme also defrauded insurers into paying for the drug. From 1999 to 2017, some 400,000 people died from overdoses involving an opioid, including prescription and illicit drugs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Kapoor was the company's founder ... who did not hesitate to use the authority of his financial position to dictate the criminal strategies employed by Insys,\" Lelling's office wrote in a filing with the court. \"He was the principal leader, who personally approved, and thereafter enforced, the corrupt strategies employed throughout the conspiracy.

French officials said there had also been two cases found in France, the first in Europe, while Nepal reported South Asia's first case. European bourses, which had dropped on Thursday, finished solidly higher Friday in the first session since the World Health Organization stopped short of declaring a public health emergency. \"There's a hope that the coronavirus is contained, particularly in China,\" Interactive Investor analyst Richard Hunter told AFP. \"And that's something of a relief rally -- (and) also with the earning season so far so good. \"So the last few days provided an opportunity to investors to buy on the cheaper side,\" Hunter added.

Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments said the virus still appeared to be contained but \"if we start getting more cases showing up around the world, that would be a bad sign for global economic growth.\" Sarhan said Friday's losses also reflected profit taking following a run of Wall Street records in recent weeks.

A Canadian judge said on Thursday she will announce her decision at a later date after she ended the first phase of an extradition hearing that will decide whether a top executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei is sent to the United States. This week's hearings dealt with the question of whether the US charges against Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder, are crimes in Canada as well. Her lawyers argued the case is really about US sanctions against Iran, not a fraud case. They maintain since Canada does not have similar sanctions against Iran, no fraud occurred. Canada arrested Huawei's chief financial officer in December 2018 at Vancouver's airport at the request of the US as she was changing flights. The US Justice Department accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment to Iran in violation of US sanctions. It says Meng, 47, committed fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company's business dealings in Iran. On Thursday, Canadian Department of Justice lawyer Robert Frater told Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes that fraud is at the heart of the case and by lying to the bank, Meng put the bank at risk. Frater said sanctions were the reason for the meeting with the bank, but it is the alleged misrepresentation that matters to the United States. In his closing summation, defence lawyer Richard Peck reiterated the defence argument that sanctions, not fraud, are the essence of the case. Homes said she would reserve her decision.

Raising, transporting or selling all wild animal species is forbidden \"from the date of the announcement until the national epidemic situation is over\", said a government directive. The ban was issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. The lethal virus, which has caused 56 confirmed deaths and nearly 2,000 total infections in China, and spread to about a dozen countries, is believed to have originated in a market in the central city of Wuhan, where a range of wildlife was reportedly sold. Conservationists have long accused China of tolerating a shadowy trade in exotic animals for food or as ingredients in traditional medicines, including highly endangered species such as the pangolin or tiger. Health experts say the trade poses a significant and growing public health risk as potentially dangerous animal-borne pathogens that people would normal not be exposed to make the jump to humans. The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-03 also has been traced to wild animals, with scientists saying it likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets. Civets, a cat-like creature, were among dozens of species listed on an exhaustive price list for one of the animal-trading businesses at the Wuhan market that emerged online last week.

Kosovo and Serbia agreed on Monday to launch direct commercial flights after a two-decade interval in a deal mediated by the United States in an attempt to push the two former foes closer to normalising relations. Direct flights were halted in 1998 when war broke out in Kosovo between ethnic Albanian insurgents and Serbian security forces. Serbia lost control of Kosovo after NATO bombing in 1999 to drive out Serb forces, ending a counter-insurgency in which more than 13,000 people, mainly Kosovo Albanians, were killed. Monday's deal was signed at the US embassy in Berlin. \"This event marks another step in our efforts to normalise relations between Kosovo and Serbia,\" Kosovo President Hashim Thaci said in a statement. Thaci said the deal was reached with the \"contribution\" of the US President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, and US ambassador to Berlin, Richard Grenell. Grenell was appointed by Trump in October last year as special envoy for talks between Belgrade and Pristina. \"President Donald Trump once again led us to a historic victory,\" Grenell wrote on his Twitter account. There were no details on when the flights would start but officials in Kosovo said that Eurowings, a low-cost company owned by Lufthansa, would be involved. The road distance from Pristina to Belgrade is 350 km (218 miles), around four hours by car. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the deal. NATO has some 4,000 peacekeepers in Kosovo and is responsible for the control of Kosovo's airspace. \"This is an important step which will make the circulation of people and goods easier and faster within the Western Balkans region,\" Stoltenberg said in a statement. Kosovo has now been recognised by more than 110 countries including the United States, but not by Serbia, Russia or China.

The rise in the number of international tourist arrivals slowed to 4.0 percent in 2019, its slowest rate since 2016 due to a cooling global economy, geopolitical tensions and uncertainty regarding Brexit, the World Tourism Organization said on Monday. The Madrid-based UN body, UNWTO, predicted global tourism will grow by 3.0-4.0 percent this year, buoyed by major sporting and cultural events such as the Tokyo Olympics in Japan. The number of international tourist arrivals hit 1.5 billion last year, up from 1.4 billion in 2018, the body said in a statement. Tourist numbers grew by 6.0 percent in 2018, 7.0 percent in 2017 and by 4.0 percent in 2016. \"The slowdown in linked to the results of the global economy, with economic growth of around 3.0 percent,\" UNWTO's market intelligence chief, Sandra Carvao, told a news conference. She said \"strong uncertainty around\" Britain's looming exit from the European Union, simmering geopolitical tensions and the collapse of Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm, had also contributed to the slowdown. But Carvao stressed that both 2017 and 2018 had posted exceptionally high rates of tourism growth. \"What is happening is we are returning to historical levels of tourism growth,\" she said. Europe and the Asia-Pacific region were the most affected by the slowdown in tourism arrivals. Arrivals rose by 4.0 percent in Europe in 2019, down from 6.0 percent in 2018, while in Asia-Pacific arrivals rose by 5.0 percent compared to 7.0 percent in 2018 as ongoing protests in Hong Kong weighed the sector down. Africa posted a 4.0-percent rise in tourist arrivals, down from 9.0 percent in 2018. The Middle East was the one bright spot as tourist arrivals in the region jumped by 8.0 percent in 2018, up from 3.0 percent in the previous year, due mainly to Saudi Arabia's ambitious plan to draw foreign visitors.

The fires have killed 29 people and millions of animals, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and razed an area roughly a third the size of Germany since September, and scores of fires continued to burn on the east coast despite recent rain. The Australian Open got underway on schedule in relatively clear air in Melbourne on Monday, after thick bushfire smoke caused havoc with preparations last week and forced one player to retire from qualifying. \u201cI definitely was concerned, and am ...

Turkey's treasury and finance minister said the country expected to attract $15 billion in direct foreign investments this year. The Turkish Lira should become a competitive currency as regional risks continue, Berat Albayrak said at the press meeting in Istanbul. Underlining that Turkey is a \"producing, exporting\" country, he said \"regional risks were here yesterday, are here today and will be here tomorrow\". He stressed that the country's year-end inflation was below the government's target of 15.9 percent thanks to \"strong support\" by all shareholders and said that \"inflation will continue to be the most important anchor for 2020 and onwards\". Albayrak said the country would leave 2019 behind with a soft landing that \"went down in history\" and with a positive growth rate. The Turkish economy expanded 0.9 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2019 after contracting 2.3 percent in the first quarter and 1.6 percent in the second quarter, on an annual basis. Albayrak underlined that the country focused on balanced, disciplined and real growth with the backing of its manufacturing sector rather than \"mad growth or mad contraction as it was used to see\". He stressed that the country would continue to introduce incentive packages to support the transformation of the domestic economy. \"The incentives will be focused on employment and the real sector and will substitute imports in many sectors and be export-oriented,\" he added. Albayrak noted that employment would see recovery in 2020 as the government formulates two extra strategies. \"Employment is where we will see the benefits of the balancing process most clearly,\" he said.

This year was the first time the \"Edelman Trust Barometer\", which for two decades has polled tens of thousands of people on their trust in core institutions, sought to understand how capitalism itself was viewed. The study's authors said that earlier surveys showing a rising sen se of inequality prompted them to ask whether citizens were now starting to have more fundamental doubts about the capitalist-based democracies of the West. \"The answer is yes,\" David Bersoff, lead researcher on the study produced by US communications company Edelman. \"People are questioning at that level whether what we have today, and the world we live in today, is optimised for their having a good future.\" The poll contacted over 34,000 people in 28 countries, from Western liberal democracies like US and France to those based on a different model such as China and Russia, with 56% agreeing that \"capitalism as it exists today does more harm than good in the world\". The survey was launched in 2000 to explore the theories of political scientist Francis Fukuyama, who after the collapse of communism declared that liberal capitalist democracy had seen off rival ideologies and so represented \"the end of history\".

The world\u2019s second-largest economy grew by 6.1 percent, down from 2018\u2019s 6.6 percent, already the lowest since 1990, government data showed on Friday. Growth in the three months ending in December held steady at the previous quarter\u2019s level of 6 percent over a year earlier. Business sentiment received a boost from on Wednesday's signing of an interim deal in the costly war over Beijing's technology ambitions and trade surplus. The Trump administration agreed to cancel planned tariff hikes on additional Chinese imports and Beijing promised to buy more American farm goods, though punitive duties already imposed by both sides stayed in place. The Chinese downturn might not have bottomed out yet, but improved activity in December suggested the cooling of tensions might be encouraging companies and consumers to spend and invest, private-sector economists said.

Apple is temporarily closing its 42 stores in mainland China, one of its largest markets, as a new virus spreads rapidly and the death toll there rose to 304 on Saturday.

Apple's online store will remain open. China is the company's third biggest market in terms of sales behind the United States and Europe and it is also where most iPhones and other devices are made. CEO Tim Cook told analysts on Tuesday that uncertainty due to the outbreak was keeping the Cupertino, California-based company from offering more specific guidance about its financial performance in the coming months after announcing results for the holiday shopping season that were far better than investors anticipated. That performance propelled Apple's stock price to new highs earlier this week, but the escalating uncertainty about the situation in China quickly dampened spirits. Apple shares dropped 4% Friday to finish at $309.51. In a Saturday note, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives predicted the store closures will have a \u201cnegligible\" impact on Apple, largely because consumers in mainland China will still be able to buy iPhones and other products through online channels.

India relaxed its fiscal deficit target on Saturday, raising spending and slashing taxes as it seeks to attract foreign investment and increase consumption in the wake of a prolonged economic slowdown. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the changes as part of the country's annual budget in parliament, a day after official data showed that Asia's third-largest economy grew five percent last year, its slowest expansion since the 2008 global financial crisis. In a sprawling three-hour speech peppered with references to ancient Indian history and poetry, Sitharaman said the fiscal deficit target for the current financial year was now 3.8 percent of GDP, up from an earlier 3.3 percent. It will edge down to 3.5 percent next year, she added. 'Taxpayers will not be harassed' Prime Minister Narendra Modi's right-wing government has been trying desperately to revive the economy, which has flagged for several quarters, with per capita consumption falling for the first time in four decades. The finance minister said Indians earning under 1.5 million rupees ($21,000) a year could pay lower taxes if they agreed to forego existing exemptions, with a view to raising their purchasing power. Indian taxpayers are allowed to claim exemptions for a range of expenses, from medical insurance to vacation spending, under a labyrinthine tax regime that Sitharaman has vowed to simplify during her tenure. She also announced that companies would no longer have to pay dividend distribution tax, terming it a \"bold move meant to attract foreign investors\". \"Wealth creators will be respected in this country... and this government assures taxpayers they will not be harassed,\" she said in her second budget speech since Modi won landslide re-election last May. 'All talk' The key agriculture sector will receive a cash infusion of 2.83 trillion rupees ($39.58 billion) to help farmers set up solar power units and storage facilities.

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury retailer, added that its net profit had jumped by 13 per cent from 2018 to $7.89 billion (7.17 billion euros) . \"We can count on the strength of our brands and the agility of our teams to reinforce, once again in 2020, our leadership in the universe of high-quality products,\" chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault said in a statement. The group recorded sales of $59 billion (53.7 billion euros), an annualised gain of 15 per cent. While hailing the results, Arnault sounded a slight note of caution, saying: \"In a buoyant environment that remains uncertain in 2020, we continue to be vigilant and focused on our objectives for progress.\" The group highlighted growth in Europe and the United States, and noted that results were also strong in Asia \"despite a difficult environment in Hong Kong in the second half of 2019.\" In terms of product lines, the statement underscored \"exceptional growth at Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior\" along with the addition last year of the Belmond hotel group, a partnership with British designer Stella McCartney and an agreement to buy the prestigious US jewelry house Tiffany."}

The Bank of England on Thursday slashed its estimates for UK economic growth this year and next, one day before the country exits the European Union. It came as BoE policymakers, in governor Mark Carney's final monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting, voted to keep its main interest rate at 0.75 per cent by a 7-2 majority. \"The question facing the MPC at this meeting was whether the new decade would start with a bang,\" Carney told a press conference, adding that he had \"no regrets\" over his monetary policy record at the BoE since taking the reins in 2013. Some analysts had expected the Canada-born central banker to have joined the ranks of those demanding a quarter-point rate cut to 0.50 per cent. The minutes of the latest BoE meeting showed that two doveish policymakers had cited \"downside risks\" to the bank's projections arising from \"Brexit uncertainties and a weaker world outlook\". While not agreeing to a rate cut to help prop up Britain's economy, the central bank did predict troubles ahead. The British economy would expand by only 0.8 percent this year, the BoE said, down sharply on its previous 1.2-per cent forecast. In 2021, gross domestic product was expected to grow 1.4 percent, down on November's estimate of 1.7 per cent. 'Bank buys time' \"Given growing expectations of a rate cut this month, the overwhelming vote in favour of holding rates comes as a surprise,\" said Deloitte economist Debapratim De. \"The post-election bounce in business sentiment... seems to have bought the bank some time,\" he added in reference to the convincing election victory in December for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative party that unlocked Brexit.

Canada and Mexico already represent the top two export markets for US goods. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the new North American trade pact with Canada and Mexico into law, pronouncing a \"glorious future\" for US industry. It was another opportunity for Trump to tout successes in the midst of an impeachment trial where he is fighting charges of abuse of office and obstructing Congress. On Tuesday he announced a Middle East peace plan \u2013 rejected immediately by the Palestinians \u2013 and earlier this month he signed a truce in his trade war with China. But even if the new USMCA trade deal with America's neighbours was crafted in close consultation between Trump's Republicans and the Democrats, the president pointedly didn't invite any of the Democratic leaders to his big White House signing ceremony. The USMCA replaces the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which Trump has long targeted, saying that it resulted in shipping US jobs abroad. \"Today, we are finally ending the NAFTA nightmare,\" he said at the White House. Analysts say USMCA retains many elements of NAFTA, a mammoth deal that created a free trade zone across all of North America, shaking up entire industries and supply chains. Economists say that overall NAFTA increased growth and raised the standard of living in North America, binding the three countries in a complex web of trade rules and services. But the new deal does change content rules on auto manufacturing, to boost US jobs, and requires higher salaries for some Mexican auto workers. It also makes changes to e-commerce, intellectual property protections and dispute settlement for investors, as well as imposing tougher labour provisions, requiring reforms to Mexico's laws. 'Colossal victory' Mexico ratified the new agreement December 10, and Canada is expected to follow suit in coming weeks. For Trump, the \"colossal victory\" of USMCA fits neatly into his \"America first\" campaign message ahead of a difficult November reelection fight and his current battle to see off impeachment over alleged abuse of power"}

An award-winning investigative team published a trove of files on Sunday allegedly showing how the daughter of Angola's former president -- dubbed Africa's richest woman -- syphoned hundreds of millions of dollars of public money into offshore accounts. The New York-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) worked with newspapers such as Munich's Suddeutsche Zeitung to reveal the \"Panama Papers\" tax haven scandal in 2016. Its latest series called \"Luanda Leaks\" zeros in on Isabel dos Santos, the former Angola president's daughter. Angola's prosecutors last month froze the bank accounts and assets owned by the 46-year-old businesswoman and her Congolese husband Sindika Dokolo. Dos Santos called it a groundless political vendetta at the time. \"Based on a trove of more than 715,000 files, our investigation highlights a broken international regulatory system that allows professional services firms to serve the powerful with almost no questions asked,\" the ICIJ wrote. The group said its team of 120 reporters in 20 countries was able to trace \"how an army of Western financial firms, lawyers, accountants, government officials and management companies helped (dos Santos and Dokolo) hide assets from tax authorities\". Dos Santos's lawyer dismissed the ICIJ findings as a \"highly coordinated attack\" orchestrated by Angola's current rulers. \"It is obvious that our client is the subject of a highly coordinated attack on both her reputation and business,\" the lawyer said in a statement quoted by The Guardian newspaper. Dos Santos herself told BBC Africa the file dump was part of a \"witch hunt\" meant to discredit her and her father Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The former president's daughter headed Angola's national oil company Sonangol. Forbes magazine last year estimated her net worth at $2.2 billion. Her father's successor Joao Lourenco forced her out of the oil company after becoming president in 2017. Dos Santos said on Wednesday that she would consider running for president in the next election in 2022. Western consultants The ICIJ investigation said Western consulting firms"}

Airbus bribed public officials and hid the payments as part of a pattern of worldwide corruption, prosecutors said on Friday as the European planemaker agreed a record $4 billion settlement with France, Britain and the United States. The disclosures, made public after a nearly four-year investigation spanning sales to more than a dozen overseas markets, came as courts on both sides of the Atlantic formally approved settlements that lift a legal cloud that has hung over Europe\u2019s largest aerospace group for years. \u201cIt was a pervasive and pernicious bribery scheme in various divisions of Airbus SE that went on for a number of years,\u201d US District Judge Thomas Hogan said. The deal, effectively a corporate plea bargain, means Airbus has avoided criminal prosecution that would have risked it being barred from public contracts in the United States and European Union - a massive blow for a major defence and space supplier. Prosecutors said individuals could still face criminal charges, however. Airbus, whose shares closed down 1 percent, has been investigated by French and British authorities for alleged corruption over jet sales dating back more than a decade. It has also faced US inquiries over suspected violations of US export controls. \u201cIn reaching this agreement today, we are helping Airbus to turn the page definitively\u201d on corrupt past practices, French prosecutor Jean-Francois Bohnert said.

{"title": "Yemen's rival powers battle over banknotes", "content": "Yemen\u2019s warring sides opened a new front in their five-year conflict on Saturday - a battle over old and new banknotes that threatens to create two economies in the same state. As of Saturday midnight, the Houthi movement which controls the capital Sanaa outlawed the use and possession of crisp new Yemeni riyal bills issued by its rivals in the internationally recognised government based in the southern port town of Aden. The Iran-allied Houthis, who say people should only use the old bills, have defended the ban as a move against inflation and what they call rampant money-printing by the government. The government has branded the ban an act of economic vandalism. And the population, as ever, have been left stuck in the crossfire. Yemenis from both sides told Reuters the ban had effectively created two currencies with diverging values, adding to the turmoil in a state already governed by two powers and brought to its knees by the war. In the one-month buildup to the ban, people in Houthi-controlled areas have been queuing to try to exchange their new riyal notes for old, turning the grubby and torn bills into a prized and relatively scarce commodity. The riyal stood at about 560 to the dollar across Yemen before the ban was announced in mid-December. The rate has since slipped a little in Houthi-controlled areas to around 582, but slumped much further to 642 in the south, an area now awash with new bills. That relative strength might look like a boon for northerners, if only they could get hold of enough of the old notes in time to keep afloat in the largely cash-based economy. \"We go for the exchange and they won't take [the new notes] from us. Or say they need three, four or five days,\" craftsman Abdullah Saleh al Dahmasi told Reuters on a Sanaa street a week before the ban came into force. \"The new one isn\u2019t accepted and the old one is worn out, they have to find a solution,\" the 27-year-old said.

Egypt-Israeli cooperation got a major boost this month as the Jewish state began exporting natural gas to its Arab neighbour in a sharp reversal of roles. Just a decade back, Israel was dependent on Egyptian gas to meet up to 40 percent of its requirements. But after the discovery of large reserves in the offshore fields of Leviathan and Tamar, Tel Aviv has embarked on a journey to become an international player. The Cairo-Tel Aviv energy deal follows drawn-out negotiations, which included political and financial considerations and resolution of issues such as a multi-billion dollar international arbitration. It also involves a host of shadow companies registered in tax havens that are linked with Egypt\u2019s dreaded military intelligence. Within Egypt and the Arab-speaking countries in the region, the arrangement faces criticism. Egypt itself is sitting atop the Zohr gas field \u2014 the biggest find so far in the Eastern Mediterranean with 30 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of reserves. \u201cEgypt linked final approval of the deal to finding a solution to the over $2 billion in compensation that it was required to pay to Israeli companies following the halt of supplies in 2012 and Cairo was able to sharply reduce that amount [with the deal],\u201d Mona Sukkarieh, Co-Founder of Beirut-based Middle East Strategic Perspectives, told TRT World . The arbitration stems from Egypt\u2019s failure to supply the contracted gas quantity following multiple insurgent attacks on its pipeline infrastructure in 2011. A complicated backstory Egypt, one of the largest gas producers in Africa, entered the export market in the early 2000s after a spate of offshore hydrocarbon discoveries. Under the then-regime of Hosni Mubarak, it invested heavily in transnational pipelines and liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals. In 2003, Egypt began exporting gas to Jordan via the 1,200 kilometre-long Arab Gas Pipeline. Later, the pipeline was extended to Israel. This latter 100km-long subsea section connects Ashkelon in Israel to Arish in Egypt. Between 2008 and 2011, Egypt exported substantial quantities to Israel"}

Britain decided on Tuesday to give Huawei limited access to build parts of its new high-speed mobile network, in a setback for the US, which has been pushing allies to ban the Chinese company. The government said it is excluding \u201chigh risk\u201d companies from supplying the sensitive \u201ccore\u201d parts of the new fifth-generation, or 5G, networks. But it will allow high-risk suppliers to provide up to 35 percent of the less risky radio access network. The announcement did not mention any companies by name but said \u201chigh-risk vendors are those who pose greater security and resilience risks to UK telecoms networks\" - a clear reference to Huawei. The US claims that China's communist leaders could, under a 2017 national intelligence law, compel Huawei to carry out cyber espionage. Huawei denies that would be possible. The 5G infrastructure program is seen as being critical to Britain's economic future as the country leaves the European Union. But the decision is fraught, as the US objects to allowing Huawei to provide vital infrastructure and has threatened to cut off intelligence sharing with allies that do use Huawei. The British government said on Tuesday after a meeting of its National Security Council that it is taking some steps that will allow it \"to mitigate the potential risk posed by the supply chain and to combat the range of threats, whether cyber criminals, or state-sponsored attacks.'' The decision is awkward for the government of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as he risks the fury of one of Britain's closest allies at just the moment it really needs Trump's administration to quickly strike a trade deal after Brexit. Britain is also loathe to insult China, which it likewise needs for future trade deals.

Senegal has launched the first large-scale wind farm in West Africa, a facility that will supply nearly a sixth of the country's power when it reaches full capacity later this year. With the wind farm, Senegal will get 30 percent of its energy from renewable sources, which has been a goal of President Macky Sall. \"The energy mix we have today allows us to move past our dependence on petrol,\" said Papa Mademba Biteye, director general of Senelec, the national electricity company, at an inauguration ceremony in rural Taiba N'Diaye on Monday. The 158-megawatt wind farm was built by British renewable power company Lekela, which also has wind farms in South Africa and Egypt and an upcoming one in Ghana. Senegal's solar and wind farms Wind farms remain scarce throughout sub-Saharan Africa compared with solar plants, partly because they can cost more and take longer to build and because strong wind is generally less plentiful than sunshine, said Silvia Macri, an energy analyst at IHS Markit. \"Senegal pushed ahead its renewables agenda quite aggressively,\" Macri told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Senegal's first solar plant came online three years ago, and the country has since built several more. Other countries in the region are following suit with solar but are much further behind in terms of wind, Macri said. In Taiba N'Diaye, 46 giant wind turbines rise over scrubland about 90 km (56 miles) from the seaside capital. One-third are operating, and the rest are due to come online by June. Outside the cities, much of Senegal is still not electrified. Electricity reached only about 60 percent of the 16 million population in 2017, according to the World Bank. The wind farm will provide enough electricity for 2 million people and prevent the emission of 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, according to Senelec. \"The next challenge is universal access,\" said Biteye."}

The announcement, made late on Monday according to the official Xinhua News Agency, comes after an initial suspension of the trade and consumption of wildlife in January. Scientists suspect, but have not proven, that the new coronavirus passed to humans from animals. The disease has now killed almost 2,700 people in China and spread to countries around the globe. Some of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to a wildlife market in Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, where bats, snakes, civets and other animals were sold. \"There has been a growing concern among people over the consumption of wild animals and the hidden dangers it brings to public health security since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak,\" said Zhang Tiewei, a spokesman for the top legislature's Legislative Affairs Commission. Zhang said it was both urgent and necessary for the decision to be made at the \"critical moment for the epidemic prevention and control\". The decision, made by the National People's Congress, stipulates the illegal consumption and trade of wildlife will be \"severely punished\" as will be hunting, trading or transporting wild animals for the purpose of consumption. The use of wild animals for non-edible purposes, including scientific research, medical use and display, will be subject to strict examination, approval and quarantine inspection.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) is developing rules to make digital companies pay tax where they do business, rather than where they register subsidiaries - a move that was broadly endorsed by finance leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) major economies on Sunday. Yet the OECD efforts were stalled late last year by last-minute changes demanded by Washington, including a proposed \u201csafe harbour\u201d regime which critics say would let multinationals choose whether to abide by the new set of rules or stick to existing regulations. \u201cI told my counterparts that Japan is very concerned about the \u2018safe harbour\u2019 proposal,\u201d Aso told reporters after attending the G20 gathering. \u201cIt would extremely diminish the regulatory effect of what we\u2019re trying to do.

Many G20 officials view the United States as reluctant to deal with a potentially tricky political matter before the presidential election later this year. It is rare for Japan to openly criticise the United States on economic policy, given the two countries\u2019 close defence ties. The taxing of global digital firms such as Amazon, Google and Apple - and the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on the global economy - have figured prominently at the weekend gathering of G20 finance leaders in Riyadh.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), when asked about the debris, said it could not confirm Boeing's numbers. An FAA spokesman said the agency was aware that Boeing was conducting a voluntary inspection for FOD, adding that FAA had increased its surveillance based on initial inspection reports and would take further action based on the findings.

Coronavirus is easily spreading from one border to another as it deceives screening procedures by remaining in dormant form before emerging in the form of cough or sore throat. This treacherous nature of coronavirus makes it the deadliest among the family of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) viruses, and puts governments the world over on the back foot. The pandemic is yet to be contained ever since its first signs were reported in China in December, and many countries have closed their borders to keep the disease at bay. So far, at least 2,700 people have died among some 80,000 confirmed cases in the world. It has also hit Italy and Iran, taking dozens of lives and stoking fear and panic from Asia to Europe to Africa. The world tourism sector has already experienced a serious hit and if the virus remains invincible in the coming months it would cost an estimate of $1.1 trillion to the world economy. Not only will international trade be affected by the coronavirus outbreak, but also world tourism, which could suffer even more from the effects of the virus. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), the tourism sector generates more than 10 percent of world GDP, that is equal to $8.8 trillion . The WTTC also underlines that one in five new jobs were created by the tourism sector in the last five years.

An EU summit called to set the bloc's next seven-year budget ended in impasse late Friday, riven by competing groups among the 27 member states and pressure to fill a funding gap left by Brexit. Differences were \"still too great to reach an agreement,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters at the end of the two days of talks in Brussels. No date had yet been set for another summit to try again, but Merkel added that \"we are going to have to return to the subject\". The trillion-euro-plus budget, the multiannual financial framework, is meant to be operational from next year and run to the end of 2027. But the summit revealed stubborn differences between a handful of wealthy \"frugal\" states and a larger group wanting more money to meet both big European ambitions and to fill the 75-billion-euro shortfall left by Britain's exit from the EU last month. \"Unfortunately we have observed it was not possible to reach an agreement, we observed we need more time,\" said European Council President Charles Michel, who had called the extraordinary summit and stewarded the talks. He said, however, he was right to make the effort: \"As my grandmother said, to succeed you first have to try.\" 'Group vs group' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is counting on a big enough budget to meet her executive's \"geopolitical\" ambitions, said the EU discord was sign of \"democracy\". Despite Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron teaming up to back Michel in his search for an acceptable compromise, two groups of countries dug in their heels. One was the so-called \"frugal four\" made up of Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, which wanted the budget reined in to reflect the UK's absence and to avoid them having to shoulder a bigger budgetary burden. The other was the \"friends of cohesion\", 16 member states including Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Poland and Hungary that want to ring-fence EU spending"}

They rallied through the streets of Paris, Marseille, Nice, Montpellier and other towns waving placards reading \"Pass=Apartheid\" and chanting \"Freedom, freedom\". Since last Monday, citizens have been required to show the pass in public places, proving that they have been vaccinated or have recently been tested negative for the coronavirus. After a week of leniency from the police, the government has vowed to get tougher on health pass checks. And testing, unless prescribed by a doctor, will no longer be free from October.

European Union leaders will clash this week over the EU's 2021-2027 budget as Britain's exit leaves a 75 billion euro ($81 billion) hole in the bloc's finances just as it faces costly challenges such as becoming carbon neutral by 2050. The budget is the most tangible expression of key areas on which the EU members must focus over the next seven years and their willingness to stump up. For the coming seven-year cycle, the starting point for talks is 1.074% of the bloc's gross national income (GNI), or 1.09 trillion euros. By contrast, EU national budgets claw in 47% of annual output (GDP) on average. Still, disputes over hundredths of percentage points have kept EU and government officials busy for the last two years and many diplomats remain sceptical that a deal will be reached on Thursday and Friday, when leaders meet in Brussels. \"Tomorrow's summit is a complex and complicated summit because the proposal we have received does not meet our expectations\", said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Italy is one of the net contributors to the common EU pot. The EU budget gets money from customs duties on goods entering its single market, a cut of sales tax, antitrust fines imposed by the EU on companies, and from national contributions. It spends money on subsidies for EU farmers, on equalising living standards across the bloc, border management, research, security and various non-EU aid programmes. Some net contributors - the \"frugal four\" of the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark - want to limit the budget to 1.00% of GNI. Germany, the biggest contributor, is prepared to accept a bit more, but 1.07 is too high for Berlin. Cohesion Funds The European Commission has proposed 1.1% and the European Parliament, which will vote on the budget, wants 1.3%. For net beneficiaries such as Poland, larger is better.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus threatens to erase $29 billion of this year's revenue for global airlines, mostly for Chinese carriers, as travel crashes worldwide, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The trade group for global airlines said on Thursday that the virus causing Covid-19 has the potential for causing a 13 percent decline in demand for Asian carriers this year. The contraction comes at a time when Asian airlines' sales had been growing, the group said. First traffic decline since 2008 crisis Global air traffic will be reduced by 4.7 percent for the year, marking the first overall decline in such demand since the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, IATA said in a statement. How profits will be affected was still unclear, it said. The estimates foresee a scenario where Covid-19 has a \u201cV-shaped impact,\u201d similar to what happened during the SARS virus outbreak in 2003, with a sharp dive followed by a quick recovery, according to IATA. The virus, which began in China late last year, has sickened more than 75,000 people in China, more than 2,000 people have died in China. More than 1,000 cases have been found outside mainland China. International airlines including British Airways, Germany\u2019s Lufthansa, Australia\u2019s Qantas and the three largest US airlines have suspended flights to China, in some cases until late April or May. Cathay Pacific asked employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave to help it weather the crisis. Travel restrictions inside China and fear of the illness have devastated demand for domestic flights in the fast-growing China market. Many nations are warning people not to travel to China, or barring travellers from China, especially from the Wuhan area, at the centre of the outbreak.

Richards led a research team that analysed a fossil of the creature\u2019s jaw and they concluded that the specimen is the largest pterosaur found in Australia. Richards observed that \"The new pterosaur would have been a fearsome beast, with a spear-like mouth and a wingspan around seven metres.\" \u201cIt was essentially just a skull with a long neck, bolted on a pair of long wings. \u201cThis thing would have been quite savage. \u201cIt would have cast a great shadow over some quivering little dinosaurs who wouldn\u2019t have heard them coming until it was too late.\u201d Richards went on to say.

The Taliban, which barred women from work when it ruled Afghanistan between 1996-2001, has repeatedly said the rights of women will be protected should it return to power in Kabul.

Tens of thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate as \"unprecedented\" levels of torrential rain hit western Japan, raising the risk of floods and landslides. The country's weather agency on Friday said downpours are forecast to continue for several days over a large swathe of the country, from the northern Tohoku region to Kyushu in the south. \"There is a possibility that a grave disaster will occur\" in the coming days, a Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) official told an emergency news conference shown live on public broadcaster NHK. In Unzen city in southern Nagasaki prefecture, two houses were hit by a landslide with one woman in her 50s feared dead, a local official told AFP. The heaviest rain was in Hiroshima prefecture, where non-compulsory evacuation orders were issued to at least 69,500 people and the top flood alert announced. In the city of Hiroshima, \"we have issued a special heavy rain warning. This is a level of heavy rain that we have never experienced before\", the JMA said in a statement. The agency official also called the rain in some areas \"unprecedented\". The land ministry warned that water levels are extremely high in three rivers - two running through the Hiroshima region, and one in southern Kumamoto. Scientists say climate change is intensifying the risk of heavy rain in Japan and elsewhere, because a warmer atmosphere holds more water. Downpours last month caused a devastating landslide in the central resort town of Atami that killed at least 21 people. And in 2018, more than 200 people died as floods inundated western Japan during the country's annual rainy season. On Friday, the JMA said that in the 24 hours from 6am on Friday, 300 millimetres (12 inches) of rain is expected in the northern part of Kyushu, with 200 to 250 millimetres forecast in many other parts of the country.

The tussle for money, hard-fought at the best of times, is especially problematic this time around because of Britain's departure from the EU. The \"Brexit gap\" caused by the loss of the UK's contribution is $81 billion (75 billion euros) over the 2021-2027 period, but French President Emmanuel Macron insisted this must not mean the EU should trim its ambitions by cutting spending. German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned there were \"major differences\" to overcome among the 27 countries, as some officials braced for talks to drag into the weekend. \"We are not satisfied with the current situation because the balance within the net payers has not yet been properly negotiated,\" Merkel said as she arrived. Summit host Charles Michel, the EU Council president, kicked off the day with one-on-one meetings with leaders of the 27 states starting with Sweden, one of the so-called \"frugal four\" opposed to big budget increases. \"I am convinced that it will be possible to make progress in the next hours or in the next days,\" Michel told reporters.

In response to complaints about the power wielded by large online platforms, the Commission is also considering introducing rules to stop these companies from unilaterally imposing conditions for access and use of data or benefiting from this in a disproportionate manner. The discussion paper on artificial intelligence aims to set up a framework to govern the use of this technology used by an increasing number of companies, a draft seen by Reuters showed. The rules would apply to high-risk sectors such as healthcare, transport and predictive policing. More onerous rules known as the digital services act, which could force the tech giants to take on more responsibilities for their actions and content hosted on their platforms, are expected to be announced towards the end of the year."}

A delegation from the World Bank's private lending arm met Lebanon's prime minister Tuesday, as the debt-ridden country seeks assistance to rescue its moribund economy. Lebanon has the world's third-highest debt-to-GDP ratio and has been sliding towards default in recent months, with tight capital controls and a currency devaluation already hitting purchasing power. Prime Minister Hassan Diab met a delegation from the International Finance Corporation, the NNA news agency reported. The state agency had initially said that Diab was meeting a delegation of the International Monetary Fund, instead of members of the IFC. But the IMF confirmed Tuesday it will send a mission to Beirut this week to provide advice on the nation's economic policies. Diab's government won parliament's confidence only last week, and the state immediately requested the IMF's advice on tackling the economic crisis. Lebanon is expected to decide whether to pay $1.2 billion in Eurobonds that reach maturity on March 9 or to default on its debt. Lebanon has requested help from the IMF to assess the measures needed to rebuild the economy but has not yet asked for financial assistance. A \"small IMF staff team\" will visit the country from Thursday through the weekend, fund spokesman Gerry Rice said in a statement. The aim is \"to listen to the authorities' views on how they plan to face Lebanon's economic difficulties... and provide broad technical advice on policies to deal with the macroeconomic challenges facing the economy,\" he said. However, \"Lebanon has not requested financial assistance from the IMF.\" Several ministers attended Tuesday's meeting with the IFC, according to a statement issued by Diab's office. Items discussed included \"setting up public-private cooperation projects and developing the transport sector and the airport,\" it said."}

An Indian rocket failed in its attempt Thursday to put a satellite into orbit to provide real-time images used to monitor cyclones and other potential natural disasters. A technical fault occurred in the third and final ignition stage shortly after the rocket was launched from the space center in Sriharikota in southern India, the country's space agency said. The satellite was to be geostationary, meaning it would orbit in sync with the Earth and remain over a fixed position. It would provide images of cloud bursts and thunderstorms and obtain data for agriculture, forestry and marine purposes. The space agency did not disclose what would happen to the rocket and satellite after the ignition failure. \u201cSince the third stage has not ignited, it has not attained the velocity which would keep it in orbit. It will fall back to Earth sometime soon. Tracking will tell that later,\u201d said Pallava Bagla, an outside expert.

Global defence spending saw its biggest jump in a decade in 2019, driven by the US and China, a study said on Friday, as rivalries and conflicts stoke military investment. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said the four percent rise, compared to a year earlier, was fuelled by competition between major powers, new military technologies and rumbling warfare from Ukraine to Libya. Beijing's military modernisation programme \u2013 which includes developing new hard-to-detect hypersonic missiles \u2013 is alarming Washington and helping drive US defence spending, the IISS said. Its annual \"Military Balance\" report said the increase alone in US spending from 2018 to 2019 \u2013 $53.4 billion \u2013 was almost as big as Britain's entire defence budget. \"Spending rose as economies recovered from the effects of the financial crisis, but increases have also been driven by sharpening threat perceptions,\" IISS chief John Chipman said, launching the report at the Munich Security Conference. Both the US and China increased spending by 6.6 percent, the report said, to $684.6 billion and $181.1 billion respectively. Europe \u2013 driven by ongoing concerns about Russia \u2013 stepped up by 4.2 percent, but this only brought the continent's defence spending back to 2008 levels, before the global financial crisis saw budgets slashed. European NATO members have been seeking to increase spending to placate President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly accused them of freeloading on the US. 'Destructive momentum' Trump has railed at European allies, particularly Germany, for not living up to a 2014 NATO pledge to spend two percent of GDP on defence.

The announcement from the office of the United States Trade Representative came just days after President Donald Trump said it was time to talk \"very seriously\" about a trade deal with the European Union.

The tiny island nation has little in the way of natural water sources and has long had to rely principally on supplies from neighbouring Malaysia. To boost self-sufficiency, the government has developed an advanced system for treating sewage involving a network of tunnels and high-tech plants. Recycled wastewater can now meet 40 percent of Singapore's water demand - a figure that is expected to rise to 55 percent by 2060, according to the country's water agency. While most is used for industrial purposes, some of it is added to drinking water supplies in reservoirs in the city-state of 5.7 million people. And the system helps reduce maritime pollution, as only a small amount of the treated water is discharged into the sea. \"Collect every drop\" This is a contrast to most other countries - 80 percent of the world's wastewater flows back into the ecosystem without being treated or reused, according to UN estimates. \"Singapore lacks natural resources and it is limited in space, which is why we are always looking for ways to explore water sources and stretch our water supply,\" Low Pei Chin, chief engineer of the Public Utilities Board's water reclamation department, told AFP.

The new indictment also alleges the company provided surveillance equipment to Iran that enabled the monitoring of protesters during 2009 anti-government demonstrations in Tehran, and that it sought to conceal business that it was doing in North Korea despite economic sanctions there. The company issued a statement Thursday evening disputing the allegations and calling them \u201cwithout merit.\" The new allegations come as the Trump administration raises national security concerns about Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, and aggressively lobbies Western allies to bar the company from wireless, high-speed networks. The superseding indictment, brought by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, adds to the company's legal woes in the US. It adds charges of racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets to an existing criminal case in New York, where the company already faces charges of lying to banks about deals that violated economic sanctions against Iran. Federal prosecutors in Seattle have brought a separate trade secrets theft case against the company. Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei executive and the daughter of the company's founder, is accused of making false representations to banks about Huawei's relationship with its Iran-based affiliate. She was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia, and has yet to be extradited to the US. The latest indictment, an update of a case first filed last year, accuses Huawei of plotting to steal the trade secrets and intellectual property of rival companies in the US.

Extreme heatwaves that previously only struck once every 50 years are now expected to happen once per decade because of global warming, while downpours and droughts have also become more frequent, a UN climate science report said.

READ MORE: Scientists: Earth's 'vital signs' worsening as humanity's impact deepens Key points in the report: Humans are to blame The IPCC used its strongest terms yet to assert that humans are causing climate change, with the first line of its report summary reading: \"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.\" The stark language marked a shift from previous IPCC reports, which had said it was \"extremely likely\" that industrial activity was to blame. \"There is no uncertainty language in this sentence, because there is no uncertainty that global warming is caused by human activity and the burning of fossil fuels,\" said IPCC co-author Friederike Otto, a climatologist at University of Oxford. Temperatures will keep rising The report describes possible futures depending on how dramatically the world cuts emissions. But even the severest of cuts are unlikely to prevent global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures. Without immediate steep emissions cuts, though, average temperatures could cruise past 2C by the end of the century. The scientists also looked at events considered less likely but still possible, and they could not rule out big impacts from so-called tipping points, such as the loss of Arctic ice loss or the dieback of forests.

The latest case has brought to the fore the practice of child marriage within Zimbabwe's apostolic churches. The United Nations has condemned the practice of child marriage in Zimbabwe following the death of a 14-year-old girl after she gave birth at a church shrine, an incident that caused outrage among citizens and rights activists. The UN in Zimbabwe said in a statement on Saturday that it \"notes with deep concern and condemns strongly\" the circumstances leading to the death of Memory Machaya, the 14-year-old girl from rural Marange in the east of the country. \"Sadly, disturbing reports of the sexual violation of under-age girls, including forced child marriages continue to surface and indeed this is another sad case,\" the UN said in its statement, dated August 7. The latest case has brought to the fore the practice of child marriage within Zimbabwe's apostolic churches, which also allow polygamy. The government has traditionally turned a blind eye to the practice of child marriage. Zimbabwe has two sets of marriage laws, the Marriage Act and Customary Marriages Act. Neither law gives a minimum age for marriage consent, while the customary law allows polygamy. A new marriages bill that is before parliament for debate seeks to synchronise the laws, ban marriage of anyone below 18 years and prosecute anyone involved in the marriage of a minor. 'Not an aberration, part of the same continuum' One in three girls in Zimbabwe was likely to be married before turning 18 years, said the UN, whose office in Zimbabwe groups all 25 UN agencies operating in the country. Police and the country's state gender commission said they were investigating the circumstances that led to the girl's death and burial. Local media have reported that the girl died last month but the case came to light only last week after angry relatives, who were barred by the church's security from attending her burial, told their story to the state-owned press.

An estimated 4.7 million fewer girls are expected to be born globally in the next 10 years because of sex-selective practices in countries with a cultural preference for male offspring, a trend that could undermine social cohesion in the long term, according to a research. Tuesday's research, published in the BMJ medical journal, suggested that the projected shortfall in the number of girls being born will lead to a surplus of young men in around a third of the global population by 2030, which could lead to increased anti-social behaviour and violence. Sex-selective abortions have been on the rise for the past 40 years in countries throughout southeast Europe along with south and east Asia, with as-yet undetermined demographic impacts. To model what short- and long-term effect sex selection will have on societies, an international team of researchers analysed data from more than three billion births over the last 50 years. Focusing on 12 countries where the male-to-female ratio had increased since 1970 and another 17 where that ratio was at risk of increasing due to social or cultural trends, they simulated two scenarios. The first assumed an increase in the rate of sex selection, based on statistical evidence. The second scenario assumed increased sex selection in certain countries, based on observed trends and decreased fertility, but for which specific data were lacking. In scenario 1, countries saw a shortfall of 4.7 million in the number of girls being born by 2030. For scenario 2, the figure jumped to more than 22 million globally by 2100.

With a new wave of Covid-19 infections fuelled by the Delta variant striking countries worldwide, disease experts are scrambling to learn whether the latest version of coronavirus is making people \u2013 mainly the unvaccinated \u2013 sicker than before. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that Delta, first identified in India and now dominant worldwide, is \"likely more severe\" than earlier versions of the virus, according to an internal report made public on Friday. The agency cited research in Canada, Singapore and Scotland showing that people infected with the Delta variant were more likely to be hospitalised than patients earlier in the pandemic. In interviews with Reuters, disease experts said the three papers suggest a greater risk from the variant, but the study populations are limited and the findings have not yet been reviewed by outside experts. Doctors treating patients infected with Delta described a more rapid onset of Covid-19 symptoms, and in many regions an overall increase serious cases.

In addition, it is likely that the extraordinary rate of Delta transmission is also contributing to a greater number of severe cases arriving at hospitals, the experts said. Delta is as contagious as chickenpox and far more contagious than the common cold or flu, according to the CDC report. Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, said the clearest indication that the variant may cause more severe disease comes from the Scotland study, which found that Delta roughly doubled the risk of hospitalisation compared to an earlier version."}

With climate crisis fuelling high temperatures across the Arctic, Greenland has lost a massive amount of ice with enough melting to cover the US state of Florida in 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water, scientists said. Wednesday's was the third-biggest ice loss for Greenland in a single day since 1950. The other two records, also within the last decade, happened in 2012 and 2019. The rapid melt followed warm air being trapped over the Arctic island by a change in atmospheric circulation patterns, scientists said, noting that there could be more ice lost. On Wednesday alone, some 22 gigatonnes of ice melted - with 12 gigatonnes flowing to the ocean and 10 gigatonnes absorbed by the snowpack where it can refreeze, said Xavier Fettweis, a climate scientist at the University of Liege in Belgium on Friday. 'Massive melting event' Polar Portal, a group of Danish Arctic research institutions, described it in a tweet as a \"massive melting event.\" While that volume was less than the record single-day ice melt in 2019, this week\u2019s event covered a larger area, the group said. Such events can create feedback loops that drive further warming and melting in Greenland, said Marco Tedesco, a climate scientist at Columbia University. As snow melts, it exposes darker ice or ground beneath, which absorbs more sunlight rather than reflecting it back out of the atmosphere. \"It really positions Greenland to be more vulnerable to the rest of the melting season,\" said Tedesco, research professor at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Scientists have estimated that melting from Greenland's ice sheet - the second-biggest on Earth after Antarctica\u2019s - has caused around 25% of global sea level rise seen over the last few decades. Tedesco and other scientists have warned that models used to project future ice loss do not capture the impact of changing atmospheric circulation patterns - meaning they may be underestimating the future melting of Greenland, which is located between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.

The US and China last month signed a \"phase one\" trade pact, designed to ease the commercial tensions whose knock-on effects last year battered European manufacturers. Meanwhile, Britain's departure from the European Union, pushing the risk of a fresh \"no deal\" cliff-edge back to December also helped brighten the mood. More positive \"soft\" indicators like German business sentiment surveys in Germany have prompted some analysts to see clearer skies ahead for manufacturers. Despite December's data, \"forward-looking indicators continue to point to a modest cyclical rebound in the near term\", said Frederik Ducrozet, strategist at Pictet Wealth Management.

Britain will ban the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2035, five years earlier than planned, in an attempt to reduce air pollution that could herald the end of over a century of reliance on the internal combustion engine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to use the announcement to elevate the United Kingdom's environmental credentials after he sacked the head of a Glasgow UN Climate Change Conference planned for November known as COP26. \"We have to deal with our CO2 emissions,\" Johnson said at a launch event for COP26 at London's Science Museum on Tuesday. \"As a country and as a society, as a planet, as a species, we must now act.\" The government said that subject to consultation, it would end the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars and vans in 2035, or earlier if a faster transition was possible. Countries and cities around the world have announced plans to crack down on diesel vehicles following the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal and the EU is introducing tougher carbon dioxide rules. The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025. France is preparing to ban the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040. While demand for electric vehicles has surged in Britain, Europe's second-largest market for new vehicles, diesel and petrol models still account for 90 percent of sales. Prospective buyers of greener models are worried about the limited availability of charging points, the range of certain models and the cost.

The reduction will apply to levies of five percent and 10 percent that were imposed on more than 1,700 items in September, according to the State Council Tariff Commission. Products that had been hit by the 10 percent tariffs included fresh seafood, poultry and soybeans. The tariffs also applied to items such as tungsten lamps for scientific and medical purposes, as well as some types of aircraft. The move is aimed at \"promoting the healthy and stable development of China-US economic and trade relations\", the Commission said in a statement. It said it \"hopes that both parties will be able to abide by their agreement, strive to implement its relevant content, (and) boost market confidence\". The US and China in January signed a partial deal that dialled down tensions in their bruising trade war, with Beijing agreeing to buy an additional $200 billion in American goods over the next two years.

The chief executive of developer Mobicip, Suren Ramasubbu, told Reuters he was interviewed in November by a US investigator who asked about the company's interactions with Apple. The app, which has nearly a million users worldwide, allows parents to control what their children see on their iPhones. Ramasubbu said the Mobicip app was temporarily removed from the iPhone app store last year for a failure to meet requirements imposed by Apple. A source familiar with the Justice Department's investigation said a handful of app developers had been contacted in what is the first indication of what officials are pursuing involving Apple since the investigation was revealed by Reuters in June. The US President Donald Trump has criticized Apple's Silicon Valley neighbours for other reasons, calling for closer scrutiny of social media companies and Google and accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence.

Alphabet Inc's Chief Executive Sundar Pichai unveiled sales figures that investors have long demanded, but shares fell 5 percent as Google's advertising business and the new data about YouTube and Google Cloud broadly disappointed. Pichai had sought to counter slowing revenue growth in the company's main advertising business by pointing to the Silicon Valley firm's younger units. But Pichai's reveal that Google's YouTube video streaming unit is generating ad revenue at a pace of $15 billion annually put it below rough estimates as high as $25 billion. Divulging 53 percent quarterly revenue growth for Google's cloud services compared with a year ago meant it grew slower than the business it is trying to catch up to, Microsoft Corp's Azure. It reported a 62 percent quarterly rise in sales last week, or 39 percent when considering some cloud services Microsoft sells through other units. While financial analysts applauded the new transparency from Alphabet, some questioned executives for the second time in the last four quarters to explain why overall revenue has been missing or just barely meeting their expectations. Sales growth dipped below 20 percent in three quarters during 2019, compared to just once in the previous three years. Alphabet has blamed currency exchange rates and its constant tweaking of features, saying that it is not focused on quarterly marks. \"We continue to be very focused on the benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience,\" Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat responded to an analyst. \"But there will be variability over time because we're very focused on what's in the right long-term interest.\" Shares of the company fell about 4.5 percent in extended trading to $1,416. \"The stock was priced for perfection, and a top-line miss was enough to send it lower,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \"YouTube was impressive at $15 billion for the year, Cloudless so at $8.9 billion.\" Other financial analysts said YouTube's ad revenue was underwhelming too. \"YouTube is smaller than generally assumed,"}

The US Senate on Thursday approved a revamp of the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement that includes tougher rules on labour and automotive content but leaves $1.2 trillion in annual US-Mexico-Canada trade flows largely unchanged. The legislation for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement passed on an 89-10 bipartisan vote, sending the measure to President Donald Trump for him to sign into law.

The area is responsible for 85 percent of all red chilli production in Pakistan, contributing 1.5 percent of the country's GDP.

Saleem says the time has come for the government to offer help. \"The government should intervene on an emergency basis and must introduce seeds that should be heat tolerant or heat resistant,\" he says. Farmers would normally sow chilli seeds in January, but the weather cycle in the region is changing and they are still waiting for suitable conditions to grow their crops. \"Due to climate change, weather is shifting its cycle and it causes the sudden rise of heat waves that have an impact on red chilli crops,\" explains Dr Muhammad Mithal Jiskani, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Pathology, Sindh Agriculture University, Tando Jam.

Lebanon's caretaker finance minister has asked the central bank governor to hold off on a proposed swap of 2020 Eurobonds after ratings agencies warned it could constitute a selective default, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The central bank has proposed that Lebanese holders of Eurobonds due in 2020 swap their holdings for longer-dated notes, a move that could ease pressure on dwindling foreign currency reserves amid a deep financial crisis. In a letter to central bank governor Riad Salameh, caretaker Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil said the government needed to first decide how it would finance its bonds maturing in 2020, the source said. One of the most heavily indebted countries in the world, Lebanon has $2.5 billion in Eurobonds due in 2020 including a $1.2 billion bond set to mature in March. In the letter, Khalil recognised the central bank's right to manage its own bond portfolio but asked that it hold off on the swap because of the potential implications for its sovereign rating, according to the source. Salameh told Reuters on Wednesday that no swaps would go forward before the government takes a decision on it. Lebanon has been without a government or economic rescue plan since Saad al Hariri resigned as prime minister on October 29, pushed out by sweeping protests against the ruling elite. Salameh also asked for extra powers last week, saying he wanted to standardise banking controls. Commercial banks have individually imposed controls on hard currency, putting tight caps on dollar withdrawals and blocking most transfers abroad. Protesters have been taking their frustrations over the failing economy out on banks in recent days, breaking windows and spraying graffiti on the fronts. The Finance Ministry has asked Salameh to specify exactly what extra powers were being sought and on what legal basis, the source familiar with the matter said."}

The United States and China have agreed to resume semiannual talks on economic and trade issues, according to a published report. These discussions had been conducted in previous administrations but had been halted by the Trump administration. The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that the resumption of the talks, which were started in the George W.

The newspaper said that the new talks would be separate from negotiations over a Phase Two trade deal, which will cover a number of contentious issues involving Chinese policies that the Trump administration contends are unfair trade practices but were not resolved in the Phase One negotiations. Henry Paulson had started the US-China talks when he was Treasury secretary under George W. Bush with top officials from both countries meeting twice a year. The discussions were continued during all eight years of the Obama administration although the talks were reduced to just once a year. When President Donald Trump took office in 2017, his administration halted the discussions, feeling they had failed to achieve significant results in tackling unfair Chinese trade practices and reducing America\u2019s huge trade deficits with China, the largest with any country. The Trump administration instead launched more targeted trade negotiations, which ended up triggering a tit-for-tat trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.

Aramco initially raised a $25.6 billion, which was itself a record level, in its December IPO by selling 3 billion shares at 32 riyals ($8.53) a share. But it had indicated it could sell additional shares through the over-allotment of shares. Aramco shares were flat at 35 riyals shortly after the market opened, according to Refinitiv data. A greenshoe option, or over-allotment, allows companies to issue more shares in an IPO when there is greater demand from participants in the initial offer. Investors were allocated the additional shares during book-building, Aramco said. \u201cNo additional shares are being offered into the market today and the stabilising manager will not hold any shares in the company as a result of exercise of the over-allotment option,\u201d Aramco said. Aramco shares have been volatile amid heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, which lies across the Gulf from Saudi Arabia. Aramco shares fell to 34 riyals on Jan. 8, its lowest since trading began on Dec. 11, but closed at 35 riyals on Thursday.

After nearly two years of conflict between the world's two dominant economic powers, the United States and China signed a trade truce on Wednesday, letting businesses around the globe breathe a sigh of relief. US President Donald Trump, who currently faces an impeachment trial and then a tough reelection bid later this year, called the agreement \"momentous.\" But tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in imports remain in place, leaving American consumers and businesses to foot the bill. The \"phase one\" agreement includes pledges from China to beef up purchases of American crops and other exports, provides protections for US technology, and new enforcement mechanisms. \"Today, we take a momentous step, one that's never taken before with China,\" that will ensure \"fair and reciprocal trade,\" Trump said at the White House signing ceremony. \"Together, we are righting the wrongs of the past.\" As Trump ambled through a lengthy commentary on the deal, punctuated by introductions of many officials involved in the negotiations, major networks switched away from the White House to the Congress to show the presentation of articles of impeachment in the Senate as the first step towards a trial. The easing of US-China trade frictions has boosted stock markets worldwide in recent weeks, as it takes the threat of new tariffs off the table for now.

After holding talks with environmentalists in Berlin last week, CEO Joe Kaeser said Sunday that Siemens would go ahead with plans to provide rail infrastructure for the Carmichael mine in Queensland. On Monday, activists from the Fridays for Future movement responded by protesting outside the company's offices in 15 German cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich.

The proposed mine, owned by India's Adani group, has long been controversial, but anger over the multi-billion-euro project has been fanned by Australia's catastrophic bushfire season. Amid growing calls for Siemens to quit the project, Kaeser met with leading Fridays for Future activist Luisa Neubauer in Berlin on Friday and claimed he was \"on the same side\" as environmentalists. On Saturday, Sweden's top climate activist Greta Thunberg also urged Kaeser to make what she said was \"the only right decision\". Neubauer told AFP news agency on Monday that Siemens' decision was \"disastrous\". \"We're not talking just about one provider of technical materials.

In an area of the historic district known for its printers and counterfeiters, a new service has appeared alongside documents purporting to be birth certificates, driver's licenses and passports. Customers for the fake Covid-19 vaccination certificates are usually people who want to travel but have not been fully immunised, or who received vaccines not recognised in the country they plan to visit, a vendor said. \"If they were vaccinated with the Chinese shots, here we change it for Pfizer or Sputnik V,\" said the man, who gave his name as Cris. Undeterred by the presence of police officers nearby, he told potential customers the price ranged from 1,100 to 2,000 Mexican pesos ($55-100), according to an AFP reporter. \"In two hours you'll have the document,\" he added, his face partly concealed by a face mask, as he worked in the Santo Domingo district.

The University of Hong Kong (HKU) research, based on a study of 1,442 healthcare workers, was published in Lancet Microbe on Thursday. Researchers said antibodies are not the only measure of a vaccine's success at fighting a particular disease.

Those who received Sinovac had \"similar or lower\" levels of antibodies to those seen in patients who caught and successfully fought off the disease. The study adds to the growing body of evidence that vaccines using pioneering mRNA technology \u2013 such as BioNTech and Moderna \u2013 offer better protection against the coronavirus and its variants that those developed by more traditional methods such as using inactivated virus parts.

The soil and vegetation of the Amazon hold about 200 billion tonnes of carbon, more than five times the whole world's annual CO2 emissions, according to the draft of a landmark scientific report published on Wednesday. More than 10,000 species of plants and animals are at high risk of extinction due to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest - 35% of which has already been deforested or degraded, the report said. Produced by the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA), the 33-chapter report brings together research on the world's largest rainforest from 200 scientists from across the globe. It is the most detailed assessment of the state of the forest to date and both makes clear the vital role Amazon plays in global climate and the profound risks it is facing. Cutting deforestation and forest degradation to zero in less than a decade \"is critical,\" the report said, also calling for a massive restoration of already destroyed areas. The rainforest is a vital bulwark against climate change both for the carbon it absorbs and what it stores. Furthermore, the continued destruction caused by human interference in the Amazon puts more than 8,000 endemic plants and 2,300 animals at high risk of extinction, the report added.

As it turns out, tomato fruits don't like to be eaten by caterpillars. In a study conducted by scientists at Federal University of Pelotas and Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, Embrapa Clima Temperado, researchers found that the tomato fruit, when exposed to a caterpillar, activated a defence mechanism which would make it taste unpleasant. How does it work? The tomato fruit, sensing a nearby insect, would emit electrical signals to reach the rest of the plant. These warning impulses are received by the main plant and as a result, the rest of the plant prepares to fight off the unwanted intruders. Perhaps fight is too strong a word \u2013 but the tomato fruit makes sure that the plant produces chemicals that are unpleasant to taste, so that hungry herbivores stay off the fruit. One such chemical is hydrogen peroxide, as in bleach, which the plant produces more of once it receives electrical signals from the fruit.

In studies, the two-dose Covid-19 vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna were around 95 percent effective at preventing illness, while the one-shot Johnson & Johnson shot was 72 percent effective, though direct comparisons are difficult. So while the vaccines are very good at protecting us from the virus, it\u2019s still possible to get infected with mild or no symptoms, or even to get sick.

Air pollution makes severe Covid worse Dirty air contributes to Covid-19 severity, according to a study from one of America's most polluted cities. Researchers who studied 2,038 adults hospitalised with Covid-19 in the Detroit area found those who needed intensive care and machines to help them breathe were more likely to live in neighborhoods with higher levels of air pollution and lead paint. The worse the local air contamination, the higher the odds of needing intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Dr. Anita Shallal of Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital said long-term exposure to air pollution may impair the immune system and make it more susceptible to viral infections, while fine particles in air pollution may also act as a carrier for the virus and help it spread. The study \"calls attention to the systemic inequalities that may have led to the stark differences in Covid-19 outcomes along racial and ethnic lines,\" Shallal said in a statement from the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, where she presented the findings on Friday. \"Communities of color are more likely to be located in areas closer to industrial pollution, and to work in businesses that expose them to air pollution.\" READ MORE: Delta variant crushes world's plans for post-Covid normality Beta variant may increase hospitalisations and deaths The Beta variant of the coronavirus may be deadlier than the original version of the virus, according to researchers in South Africa who studied more than 1.5 million Covid-19 patients.

The Yildiz Porcelain and Tile Factory is located in the midst of a heavenly woods called Yildiz Parki, in Istanbul\u2019s Besiktas district. The historical establishment goes back to the late 19th century.

The reason for it being set up was to have a factory in the same vein as those supplying European courts and to have the output to promote Ottoman identity around the world. The factory, manager Serife Tuba Uzun tells TRT World , was damaged in the earthquake of 1894, and was rebuilt by Italian architect Raimondo d\u2019Aronco and continued its production. The porcelain and tile output of the factory, Uzun says, was offered as gifts to foreign dynasties as well as used in the decoration of Ottoman palaces, pavilions and summer palaces. The same beautiful vases and plates and tiles that were once fit for kings and princes are now available for the general public, being sold in stores of locales under the Directorate of National Palaces. While there is a 130-year history to the factory, it didn\u2019t operate throughout all this time uninterrupted. In 1909, production stopped when Sultan Abdulhamid II was removed from power.

Former US cardinal Theodore McCarrick has been charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy, court documents have showed, making him the most senior Roman Catholic official in America to face criminal charges in the massive clergy abuse scandal. The 91-year-old, a former archbishop of Washington DC, was slapped with three counts of indecent assault and battery against a child over 14, according to a filing in a Massachusetts district court. McCarrick was thrown out of the Catholic Church in 2019, becoming the highest-ranking Church figure to be expelled in modern times. He had been found guilty by the Vatican of sexually abusing at least one teenage boy in the 1970s and of sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians. McCarrick, who played a key role in raising funds for the Holy See from wealthy US donors, was stripped of his cardinal's title in 2018 before he lost his priest's status the following year. A 450-page Vatican report published in 2020 concluded that McCarrick was able to rise through the ranks of the Church despite years of sexual misconduct allegations. The Vatican admitted last November that late pope John Paul II ignored advice against promoting McCarrick over the sexual assault rumours that were later substantiated.

A Canadian geologist may have found the earliest fossil record of animal life on Earth, according to a report published in the journal Nature . Around a billion years ago, a region of northwest Canada now defined by steep mountains was a prehistoric marine environment where the remains of ancient sponges may be preserved in mineral sediment, the paper says. Geologist Elizabeth Turner discovered the rocks in a remote region of the Northwest Territories accessible only by helicopter, where she has been excavating since the 1980s. Thin sections of rock contain three-dimensional structures that resemble modern sponge skeletons. \u201cI believe these are ancient sponges \u2014 only this type of organism has this type of network of organic filaments,\u201d said Joachim Reitner, a geobiologist and expert in sponges at Germany's University of Gottingen, who was not involved in the research.

Changes in eyes help confirm long Covid diagnosis Changes in nerve fibers in the eyes can help confirm a diagnosis of \"long Covid\" - debilitating symptoms that persist more than four week after recovery from the acute illness, according to new findings. Because nerve fiber damage is suspected to underlie some of these lingering symptoms, ophthalmologists used a non-invasive technique called corneal confocal microscopy to check for nerve damage in the cornea. In their study of 40 Covid-19 survivors - most of whom had not been sick enough to need extra oxygen - and 30 uninfected individuals, the researchers found \"significant associations\" between nerve fiber loss in the cornea and the presence and severity of long Covid symptoms related to nerves, muscles and bones. The corneal changes were most evident in patients with persistent neurological symptoms, such as loss of taste and smell, headache, dizziness, numbness and nerve pain, according to a report published on Monday in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.

For more than a century, a Babylonian clay tablet has been sitting in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum in Turkey. It is now identified as the earliest known example of applied geometry, which means Pythagorean triples were practised 1,000 years before its known inventor, Pythagoras. A Sydney mathematician, Dr Daniel Mansfield at the University of South Wales was behind the discovery. In a research published in Foundations of Science on Wednesday, the mathematician said the 3700-year-old artefact was used to measure land boundaries. The tablet details legal and geometric details about a field that has been split after some of it were sold off. \u201cSometimes the most amazing discoveries are hiding in plain sight. It\u2019s a discovery that will completely change the way we view the history of mathematics,\u201d the researcher said.

But until now we didn't know why,\" Mansfield said. \"What were they doing with this highly advanced understanding of mathematics?

A large portion of the cash being requested from the WHO's partners is needed to buy tests, oxygen and face masks in poorer nations, says the document which is expected to be released this week. And a quarter of it would be to buy hundreds of millions of vaccines for them that would otherwise go elsewhere. The paper, still subject to changes, outlines the results and financial needs of the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), the programme co-led by the WHO to distribute fairly Covid-19 vaccines, drugs and tests across the world. The programme, set up at the start of the pandemic, remains vastly underfunded, and its coordinators are now acknowledging it will remain so as many governments look to address global Covid needs \"differently\", an ACT-A official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. As a result, it has cut by nearly $5 billion its total request for funds, the document shows. But it still needs $16.8 billion, almost as much as what has been raised so far, and $7.7 billion is required urgently. The document also calls for a further $3.8 billion, on top of the $7.7 billion, to take up options for 760 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines that would be delivered next year.

Turning the clock back to pre-pandemic days still sounds like a utopian dream, but many countries are fast lifting the Covid-19 measures, opening up markets and allowing tourists so that the threat of the virus does not change business as usual forever. But with different Covid-19 variants emerging in India, the UK and elsewhere, many wonder whether it is too early to take steps towards full normalisation. Speaking to TRT World , Professor Dr. Abdullah Sayiner from Ege University\u2019s department of chest disease, warned against the Delta variant of the coronavirus, saying it poses a serious threat to humanity as it is much more contagious than the previous variants. \u201cThe vaccination rate is not sufficient. The early data said that Delta plus can infect previously infected or vaccinated people. So there is a serious threat ahead of us,\u201d Sayiner said. Despite inequality to access the Covid-19 vaccine, many developed countries have been carrying out mass vaccination campaigns in recent months. As of Tuesday, nearly 24.4 percent of the world population has received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine while the inoculation rate has already surpassed 50 percent in some Western countries, including the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK, according to Our World in Data . The threat of the Delta variants has made a third Covid-19 wave inevitable. In its assessment in May, the Public Health Authority of England warned that the Delta variant was 51 percent to 67 percent more contagious than the Alpha variant, which first appeared in the UK last year. The Delta variant was first detected in India, where out of 400,000 Covid deaths, 200,000 were caused by the Delta variant between March and May. After India, it became the dominant strain in the UK and increased the daily case numbers from 1,354 on May 1 to 27,781 on July 1 .

Turkey has slammed a ruling by a top European Union court allowing the banning of headscarves under certain conditions as a \"clear violation of religious freedoms\", adding the move would exacerbate prejudices against Muslim women in Europe. The Luxembourg-based EU Court of Justice (CJEU) ruled on Thursday that companies in the bloc can ban employees from wearing a headscarf under certain conditions, if they need to do so to project an image of neutrality to customers. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement the ruling was a sign of rising Islamophobia at a time when it said Muslim women in Europe are being subjected to increasing discrimination for their religious beliefs. \"The CJEU decision, at a time when the Islamophobia, racism and hatred that have taken Europe hostage are rising, disregards religious freedom and creates a basis and legal cover for discrimination,\" the ministry said. On Saturday, the Turkish presidency's communication director Fahrettin Altun condemned the move, saying \"this wrong decision is an attempt to grant legitimacy to racism.\" Turkey to publish reports on anti-Islam sentiments The issue of the hijab, the traditional headscarf worn around the head and shoulders, has been divisive across Europe for years, underlining sharp differences over integrating Muslims. Ankara has repeatedly accused European nations of not doing enough to prevent discrimination against Muslims, saying it will start publishing an annual report on what it calls examples of Islamophobia around the world. In response to whether headscarf bans at work represented a violation of the freedom of religion, the CJEU said such bans were possible if justified by an employer's need to present a neutral image. Ties between Ankara and the bloc have been strained over a host of issues, namely over a dispute between EU member Greece and Turkey over maritime jurisdiction and energy rights in the eastern Mediterranean.

A government tally showed 679 pandemic-related deaths in the previous 24 hours, as Russia battles a surging outbreak driven by the highly infectious Delta variant and worsened by a lagging vaccination drive. Russia, the fifth worst-hit country in the world in terms of total cases, has refused to impose a full lockdown since the first wave of the pandemic last year. It continues to host mass events, including Euro 2020 football fixtures in Saint Petersburg. The surge in infections prompted President Vladimir Putin this week to once again urge Russians to get vaccinated in an annual televised phone-in session with the nation. The Kremlin stressed Friday that a new lockdown was off the table. \"Nobody wants any lockdowns, and yes, it is not up for debate,\" said Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"It is not being discussed.\" Turkey registers 4,891 new cases Turkey has reported 4,891 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, including 461 symptomatic patients, according to the official figures.

The removal of the plaque comes as the US government embarks on a nationwide investigation aimed at uncovering the troubling history of boarding schools that sought to assimilate Indigenous youth into white society over many decades.

Moderna Inc's Covid-19 vaccine has shown promise against the Delta variant first identified in India in a lab study, with a modest decrease in response compared to the original strain, the drugmaker said. The study was conducted on blood serum from eight participants obtained one week after they received the second dose of the vaccine, mRNA-1273. The vaccine provoked an antibody response against all the variants tested, according to Moderna, but one that remained inferior in all cases to the vaccine's neutralising activity against the original coronavirus strain first found in China. The vaccine was far more effective in producing antibodies against the Delta variant than it was against the Beta variant first identified in South Africa, the data showed. Against three versions of the Beta variant, the vaccine-elicited neutralising antibodies reduced six-to-eight fold compared to those produced against original strain, while modest 3.2 to 2.1 fold reductions were seen for lineages of the variant first identified in India including Delta and Kappa. \"These new data are encouraging and reinforce our belief that the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine should remain protective against newly detected variants,\" Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said.

{"title": "Istanbul Cinema Museum adds a wealth of history and memorabilia to the city", "content": "Centrally located in Beyoglu, the Istanbul Cinema Museum beckons visitors from Turkey and beyond to experience the history of cinema in the country. The Istanbul Cinema Museum, located in Atlas Pasaji, an arcade dating back to the 19th century, is off the famed Istiklal Street in Istanbul. The building was constructed after the Beyoglu fire, in 1870, by businessman Agop Koceyan during the reign of Sultan Abdulaziz. Koceyan donated the building to Taksim Vosgeperan Armenian Church, which was transferred to Aziz and Ahmet Borovali in the 1940s. In 1948, the biggest multipurpose theatre of the time, the Atlas Cinema was built in the garden behind the building. In the 1970s, Cevher Ozden bought the building which remained unused for a time, and was transferred to the Treasury in 1985, and was allocated to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in 1992. The building was restored to its former glory in 2019-2020; the Atlas Cinema was refurbished and reopened as Atlas Cinema 1948 and the Istanbul Cinema Museum was established, opening to the public in March 2021. The ceiling ornamentation is especially beautiful and visitors are advised to remember to look up. The first floor of the Istanbul Cinema Museum is dedicated to digital applications, among them a memory pool. Museum Director Ilknur Ulu says this is the first time a memory pool was used in a cinema museum setting. Visitors can drag and drop film icons to see the details of the film and a brief synopsis. The museum also boasts wax figures of legendary actors Adile Nasit as \u2018Hafize Ana\u2019 and Kemal Sunal as \u2018Tosun Pasha\u2019. A tri-panel film screen shows famous scenes from Turkish films in a thematic manner with directional loudspeakers that provide the sound as you stand under them. There is also a green screen with which visitors can insert themselves into a film of their selection, and email themselves a memento of their journey. Ulu says this feature is very popular with guests, as is the telephone room, where visitors pick up the phone to view scenes from Turkish films, subtitled in English, and hear the"}

He notes that part of the reason why the Committee\u2019s work in the first half of the decade was so influential was due to their willingness to consider \u2018In Danger\u2019 listing for the reef from 2012-2015. He points out that the Committee was focused on the big local threats to the Reef\u2019s health at the time, such as massive port development for expansion of the coal and gas industry, water pollution from poor farming practices and destructive fishing practices. The result of the first probation on Australia was the 2015 presentation of Australia\u2019s Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan to the Committee.

In the summer of 2018, geologist Rose Turnbull was in California, sorting through grains of fine sand. She is a researcher based in New Zealand, and she was looking at tiny crystals of zircon to get a better understanding of the eighth continent of Zealandia, known as Te Riu-a-Maui in Maori. As one of the authors of a recent study published in Geology , she and her colleagues wrote: \u201cZircon is the foremost deep-time recorder of Earth\u2019s history, preserving a rich archive of isotope information that informs on magma parentage and crust-mantle evolution. Unlike whole rocks, zircon is highly resistant to alteration and weathering.\u201d The zircon crystals came from rocks collected from the islands of New Zealand, which, according to a National Geographic article, are among the few bits of Zealandia's nearly two million square miles that poke above the sea. \u201cOnly recently recognised by scientists, Zealandia is the most submerged, thinnest, and youngest continent yet found.\u201d Turnbull, who works for the research and consulting firm GNS Science in New Zealand, and her colleagues were curious about the processes that shaped the unique landmass. They were surprised by their discovery, that hidden underneath the eastern side of New Zealand\u2019s South and Stewart Islands was a chunk of a billion-year-old supercontinent.

The devices were placed at five different points in the Gulf of Izmit and off Pendik to contain the mucilage. Mucilage has increased around the coast of historical Gallipoli peninsula in northwestern Canakkale province since Monday.

The United States will ship 2.5 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to Taiwan on Saturday, a senior administration official has told Reuters. The figure is more than three times the Washington's previous allocation of shots for the island, which has faced increasing political and military pressure from China. Washington, competing with Beijing to deepen geopolitical clout through so-called \"vaccine diplomacy\", initially had promised to donate 750,000 doses to Taiwan, but is increasing that number as President Joe Biden's administration advances its pledge to send 80 million US-made shots around the world. China, which considers Taiwan an integral part of its territory, has repeatedly offered to send coronavirus vaccines to the island, which has been battling a spike in domestic infections. Taipei has expressed concern about the safety of Chinese shots. The 2.5 million donated doses of the Moderna Inc vaccine will leave Memphis, Tennessee, on a flight belonging to Taiwan's China Airlines early on Saturday and arrive in Taipei on Sunday evening, the senior US administration official said, adding that the prompt delivery was due to experts from both sides being able to work out regulatory issues.

Pakistan has opened its first government-funded school for transgender women, who are often bullied out of mainstream education as children in the deeply conservative nation. The country's Khawaja Sira community date back hundreds of years and are treated as a third sex in South Asia. Many are ostracised by their families and shunned by society, earning a living through dancing, begging or sex work. Murad Raas, education minister for Punjab province where the school is based, vowed to provide \"education for everyone\" as he announced the opening of the school this week in the central city of Multan. Staffed by transgender teachers, the school will provide afternoon classes and vocational training. A student at the school named Baby Doll, in her 20s, said the behaviour of teachers and other staff at institutions she had previously attended was upsetting. \"Boys used to tease us and misbehave with us,\" she added. \"We are trying to restore the disconnect with education [that transgender people experience],\" said Hina Chaudhary, a senior official from the Punjab education department, which plans to open further such schools.

The UN has spoken of possible war crimes by all sides in Tigray's war. Berhane Gebrezigher, an ethnic Tigrayan, remembers lying in a ditch full of men who, like himself, had been shot and left for dead. He called out: \"Is there anyone breathing?\" It was mid-January, more than two months into an ethnic conflict that has convulsed western Tigray, an area of rich farmland in Ethiopia's north where two of the country's ethnic groups \u2013 Tigrayans and Amharas \u2013 used to live and work the soil together. When the sun rose, the old man faced a choice: die in the ditch or haul himself to the road. Painfully, he began shuffling upwards. Berhane, 74, says he was among more than 50 Tigrayan civilians rounded up and trucked by Amhara forces to the Tekeze River that bisects Tigray. The forces ordered the men to climb down into what appeared to be a freshly dug ditch, Berhane said. Then the gunmen fired. Berhane was hit in both legs and in the back; he said he lay among the bodies, listening to the men reload and shoot at anyone who moved. Five Tigrayan witnesses told Reuters they saw dozens of dead. The ethnic bloodletting by the river broke out amid a violent power struggle in Tigray \u2013 between the Ethiopian government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the region's former rulers, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). Tigrayans are in the majority in their home region but make up less than six percent of the wider population.

For Khanyisa life was difficult from the start. Born as an albino, at four months old she got caught in a poaching snare in South Africa's Kruger National Park that cut through her mouth. Trapped for four days, dehydrated and unable to eat because of her wounds, she was rescued and taken to a sanctuary in Mpumalanga, north east of Johannesburg. She was later transferred to Hoedspruit Elephant Rehabilitation and Development (HERD), where she now lives with a herd of elephants led by patriarchal bull, Jabulani. Adine Roode, HERD founder, said snaring is on the rise due to human overpopulation and dwindling wildlife habitats. People set the snares to poach large game or catch smaller prey for food or for sale. READ MORE: Pakistan's lonely elephant Kaavan set to leave for Cambodia Many elephants in the herd were also orphaned and hand-raised, Roode said. \"I think that is part of the reason that they accept the orphans, because they know how it feels,\" she said.

Khanyisa, whose name means sunshine in the local Tsonga language, is able to shelter in larger elephants' shadows on sunny days to protect her skin. If the herd grows too big for the area, Khanyisa and the other elephants will be released back into the wild. Khanyisa's special bond with sheep Lammie Khanyisa has bonded with a sheep named Lammie, who has provided support as a surrogate mother to orphaned rhinos and other elephant calves that come to HERD.

{"title": "How the pandemic changed our vocabulary", "content": "It not only changed how humans live but also added new words to their lexicon. The famous philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once said in most cases, \u201cthe meaning of a word is its use in the language\u201d which keeps changing from time to time. The spread of the viral plague from early 2020 proved Wittgenstein right. While some new words were invented, the meanings of some common words changed. And some abbreviations defined the circumstances that people weren't familiar with before. Here\u2019s a selection of signature words and phrases of the Covid-19 era: Zoom fatigue: After the coronavirus pandemic, many people have turned to virtual meetings to avoid transferring the virus. A video communication company came up with a software called Zoom that made virtual meetings easier. With Zoom came an auxiliary verb Zooming, which gave a meaning to our on-screen work meetings, socialising, and other events. So excessive zooming leads to \u2018Zoom Fatigue\u2019. Pro tip: Stick to a time schedule, turn off your camera when you don\u2019t need it, and don\u2019t forget to get some fresh air. Zoombombing: Imagine someone crashing into your video meeting prior to the pandemic, you may have struggled to explain the situation in one word. As the pandemic paved the way for video meetings, we have a word now. It's called \u2018zoombombed\u2019. Lockdown: Although the word \u201clockdown\u201d has been used since the 16th century, its usage became common across the world since the pandemic began last year. Social distance: The origin of Covid-19 is still a mystery for scientists. But scientists agree that it\u2019s being transmitted through small liquid particles humans release when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or even breathe. Hence maintaining a social distance, meaning maintaining a safe space between yourself and other people, became an essential part of our life.

The law, part of Article 169 of the Law of Procedure before Sharia, was scrapped and replaced by an amendment that permits adult women, of rational mind, to live in separate housing, Gulf News reported on Wednesday, citing Makkah newspaper. The law was amended as part of a landmark ruling in favour of 32-year-old Mariam al Otaibi, a writer, who won her case in Saudi courts to live alone.

The world's seven largest advanced economies have agreed to stop international financing of coal projects that emit carbon by the end of this year, and phase out such support for all fossil fuels, to meet globally agreed climate crisis targets. In a communique on Friday, the Group of Seven nations \u2014 the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan \u2014 plus the European Union said, \"international investments in unabated coal must stop now.\" \"(We) commit to take concrete steps towards an absolute end to new direct government support for unabated international thermal coal power generation by the end of 2021, including through Official Development Assistance, export finance, investment, and financial and trade promotion support.\" Stopping fossil fuel funding is seen as a major step the world can make to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, which scientists say would avoid the most devastating impacts of climate crisis. Getting Japan on board to end international financing of coal projects in such a short timeframe means those countries, such as China, which still back coal are increasingly isolated and could face more pressure to stop. Call for pressure on China Coal is considered unabated when it is burned for power or heat without using technology to capture the resulting emissions, a system not yet widely used in power generation. Alok Sharma, president of the COP26 climate summit, has made halting international coal financing a \"personal priority\" to help end of the world's reliance on fossil fuel, calling for the UN summit in November to be the one \"that consigns coal to history.\" He called on China to set out its \"near-term policies that will then help to deliver the longer-term targets and the whole of the Chinese system needs to deliver on what President Xi Jinping has set out as his policy goals.\" Zero emission vehicles"}

The catastrophic scale of the Covid-19 pandemic could have been prevented but a \"toxic cocktail\" of dithering and poor coordination meant the warning signs went unheeded. The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) said a series of bad decisions meant Covid-19 went on to kill at least 3.3 million people so far and devastate the global economy. The panel was jointly chaired by former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a 2011 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Early responses to the outbreak detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 \"lacked urgency\", with February 2020 a costly \"lost month\" as countries failed to heed the alarm, said the panel. The panel of experts who reviewed the World Health Organization\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic says the UN health agency should be granted \u201cguaranteed rights of access\u201d in countries to investigate emerging outbreaks, a contentious idea that would give it more powers and require member states to give up some of theirs.

Not only are the negotiations expected to be lengthy, they are also likely to result in a waiver that is significantly narrower in scope and shorter in duration than the one initially proposed by India and South Africa, trade experts said.

A more realistic goal may be completion of the agreement in time for the WTO's next ministerial conference, scheduled for November 30 through December 3, said Willems, now a trade partner at the Akin Gump law firm in Washington. That would give vaccine producers more time to boost global supplies which could help contain the virus and ease pressure for the waiver.

Published earlier this year, \"Covid-19, suicide, and femicide: Rapid Research using Google search phrases\", also shows a spike in searches related to suicide and suicidal thoughts.

Bozlu Art Project, located in the midst of downtown Istanbul in the Sisli district, is housed in a building, the Mongeri House, designed by architect Giulio Mongeri. Mongeri was an Italian subject born in Istanbul, whose father, Dr Luigi Mongeri was a renowned psychiatrist. Giulio Mongeri built many important buildings in and around Istanbul, and his legacy is honoured by this exhibition. The exhibition \u201cMemory Palaces\u201d takes its name after the \u2018memory palace\u2019 technique \u201cused ever since the time of Ancient Greek and Roman civilisations in order to visually recall information through spatial environments\u201d, the news release advises. Curated by Ozlem Inay Erten, the exhibition starts out with the elder Mongeri (1815-1882), who was an imperial doctor in the court of Sultan Abdulmecid (1839-1861). He is known for playing a prominent role in institutionalising modern psychiatry in Turkey. His son Giulio Mongeri (1873-1951) has \u201cleft his mark on [Turkey\u2019s] architectural history\u201d, the news release notes. The Mongeri Building was originally built to house the Sadikoglu family in the early years of the Republic, who would, following the trends of the era, leave the building built in the First National Architectural Movement style, for a modern apartment building in the coming years. It later became a gynecological hospital, the Pakize Tarzi Clinic, followed by the Ataman Clinic, finally ending up as an educational institution called Yuzyil Isil Primary School before becoming the location for the Bozlu Art Project, previously housed in a building in Nisantasi. Curator Inay Erten writes about her initial impression in in the Preface to the book \u2018A Mansion in Sisli and Architect Giulio Mongeri\u2019 that the Mongeri House \u201cstood there, in the midst of the densely populated and heavily concretised most central part of Sisli, like an oasis\u201d.

The coronavirus variant discovered in South Africa can \"break through\" Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine to some extent, a real-world data study in Israel found, though its prevalence in the country is low and the research has not been peer reviewed. The study, released on Saturday, compared almost 400 people who had tested positive for Covid-19, 14 days or more after they received one or two doses of the vaccine, against the same number of unvaccinated patients with the disease. It matched age and gender, among other characteristics. READ MORE: Pfizer-BioNTech updates Covid vaccine efficacy at 91% The South African variant, B.1.351, was found to make up about 1% of all the Covid-19 cases across all the people studied, according to the study by Tel Aviv University and Israel's largest healthcare provider, Clalit. But among patients who had received two doses of the vaccine, the variant's prevalence rate was eight times higher than those unvaccinated - 5.4% versus 0.7%. This suggests the vaccine is less effective against the South African variant, compared with the original coronavirus and a variant first identified in Britain that has come to comprise nearly all Covid-19 cases in Israel, the researchers said. \"We found a disproportionately higher rate of the South African variant among people vaccinated with a second dose, compared to the unvaccinated group. This means that the South African variant is able, to some extent, to break through the vaccine's protection,\" said Tel Aviv University's Adi Stern. The researchers cautioned, though, that the study only had a small sample size of people infected with the South African variant because of its rarity in Israel. They also said the research was not intended to deduce overall vaccine effectiveness against any variant, since it only looked at people who had already tested positive for Covid-19, not at overall infection rates.

{"title": "Can Covid-19 cause diabetes and heart complications?", "content": "Medical research has emerged that indicates Covid-19 could be triggering diabetes and heart damage in people who were not predisposed. As the world continues to fight the novel coronavirus, the number of Covid-19 deaths has approached three million globally. From the near 78 million recoveries, research is beginning to make clear the severe symptoms and side effects that have emerged after contracting the virus. Reports from more than 350 clinicians are now raising questions over whether Covid-19 can cause both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in patients who recovered from the virus. Professor Francesco Rubino, a clinician at King\u2019s College London, has called for a full investigation into the possible relation between Covid-19 and diabetes. Rubino and his colleagues exchanged the anecdotal cases over a Zoom meeting, and then started to analyse diabetes cases that emerged after contracting Covid-19. \u201cOver the last few months, we\u2019ve seen more cases of patients that had either developed diabetes during the Covid-19 experience, or shortly after that. We are now starting to think the link is probably true \u2013 there is an ability of the virus to cause malfunctioning of sugar metabolism,\u201d said Rubino. Some doctors also believe Covid-19 could induce a new form of diabetes by disrupting all sugar metabolism of the human body. In America, over eight studies involving more than 3,700 Covid patients who have recovered post illness, showed that nearly 14 percent of patients went on to develop diabetes. Other recent studies have suggested a similar relationship. For example, 2.35 percent of coronavirus patients in China developed new-onset diabetes six months after they were discharged. Besides a causal link, a high proportion of people who are in intensive care units with Covid-19 also have diabetes. It has rapidly become a major disease around the world, with the risk of dying early only increasing. \"The number of people with diabetes has quadrupled in the last 40 years.
