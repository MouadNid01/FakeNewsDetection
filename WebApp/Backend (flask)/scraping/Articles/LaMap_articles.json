Reason for which he completely ignored the rights of the other party in this case and coordinated and met with people belonging to a clan known for its skepticism and nihilism,\" he said. For Tamek, the Secretary General of RSF \"should have abandoned his partiality and asked himself why he bothered to come to Morocco to defend two journalists involved in sex scandals and not respond to people like Radi Leili, Mostapha Adib and Zakaria Moumni who enjoy airtime in the French media to make comments by which they seek to undermine the Kingdom. \"The person concerned allows himself, as secretary general of RSF, to give moral lessons to the Kingdom in terms of freedoms and human rights, even though he knows very well that this organization with such an inglorious past (extreme deviation of its ex-secretary general) is itself in need"}

These reform projects and social mechanisms have led to satisfying results, he says. In order to ensure the optimal implementation of the generalization of social protection, in accordance with the Royal Guidelines, the project includes four major axes, namely the generalization of compulsory basic health insurance for 22 million additional beneficiaries in 2021 and 2022 and family allowances in 2023 and 2024 to cover nearly 7 million school-age children, he points out. It also involves the broadening by 2025 of the base of the pension schemes members to include people who exercise a job and not benefiting from any pension, and the generalization of the indemnity for loss of employment in 2025 to cover any person holding a stable job by simplifying the conditions for benefiting from this allowance and broadening the base of beneficiaries. Regarding the expansion of medical coverage, El Otmani stressed that this Royal project will accelerate the pace of implementation of government programs in this area, adding that the rate of basic medical coverage has increased over the past few years to reach around 70% of the population in 2019 against 52% in 2015 and 35% in 2012, thanks to the expansion of this coverage to several social categories.

Cooperation mechanisms have been set up for this purpose with certain countries, in particular France and Spain, which have resulted in the returning of several dozen of minors to Morocco, the statement said. The delays noted in the implementation of this cooperation are mainly linked to blockages caused by the complex (administrative and judicial) procedures in some European countries, added the same source, specifying that Morocco is the first country concerned by certain circles of civil society, or even criminal networks, which use the supposedly precarious conditions of minors as a pretext to exploit them. Morocco is ready to collaborate, as it has always done, with European countries and the European Union (EU), for the settlement of this issue, the statement said, noting that the Kingdom hopes that the EU and the countries concerned will be able to overcome the procedural constraints to facilitate this operation.

The diaspora is one of the first sources of funding for the continent, if not the first, he said noting that remittances from the diaspora represent more than three times the levels of official development assistance and foreign direct investment to sub-Saharan Africa. These transfers have also beaten predictions by being remarkably resilient to the economic effects of the pandemic with, in general, a smaller than expected decline in Africa, he added, noting that these transfers have even increased in 2020 in many countries. \"With its 150 million souls in the world, the African diaspora is primarily an opportunity for the continent. It is cemented around a sense of cultural and human belonging and brings an addition to the African identity, it shines in the societies where it evolves, \"said the minister. It is, therefore, a bridge with other continents and cultures, so it is called the \"6th sub-region\" of the continent: a region where the \"territory of life\" joined the \"territory of origin\", said Bourita noting that African migrants are often considered vulnerable people, victims of discrimination of all kinds. However, Bourita said that these difficulties have not prevented the multiplication of \"success stories\" of African figures who, throughout the world, have imposed themselves in different areas, including the economy, politics, science and culture. But, if its contribution is essential, Bourita said that the diaspora also expresses the desire to be accompanied. However, Africa has much to do in this regard since only 10% of remittances are invested in projects or savings products in Africa, he stressed.

In order to ensure the effectiveness of the implementation of this framework law, the government has created governance mechanisms, including a steering body represented by \"the national commission for monitoring and supporting the reform of the education, training and scientific research system\". Thanks to the clear vision, the legal framework and the reform, the government has been able to achieve important accomplishments, reflected in tangible effects on the education system and on a number of its indicators, said the Head of Government. Since the start of its mandate, the government has paid particular attention to human resources, bringing the annual rate of budget items from 7,063 between 2004 and 2016 to 20,160 between 2017 and 2021, he said. The government has also mobilized significant financial resources, the budget increased from 54 billion dirhams in 2016 to around 42 billion dirhams in 2021, that is an increase of 25% despite the impact of the pandemic on public finances. This financial effort also made it possible to strengthen the infrastructure of the education system in towns and villages, especially in areas that suffered from shortcomings. This has notably enabled the creation of at least 440 new schools between 2016 and 2021 and forty new-generation public universities. In order to strengthen"}

According to the CSMD report, presented on Tuesday to HM King Mohammed VI by Benmoussa, the reforms and projects proposed in the NMD will require additional public funding of around 4% of GDP annually in the start-up phase (2022-2025) and around 10% of GDP at cruising speed by 2030. The issue of NMD funding is extremely important, noted Benmoussa, stressing that it is a fundamental determinant of the success of this major transformation project, especially in these times of the new coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) which hit hard the economies of the world. Thus, this new development model, which requires the mobilization of substantial financial resources for its initiation and implementation, is based, in addition to public financing, on a strong mobilization of private investment capable of achieving its objectives, he said, welcoming the growing commitment of this sector in the investment effort in Morocco. The private sector, through its investments, can contribute to structural social transformation and greater job creation, Benmoussa said. The CSMD president also noted that the short-term debt should be used to finance in a targeted manner the projects that promote structural development and medium-long term growth, in particular in the human capital and the structural transformation of the economy. \"Today, our financing is mainly provided by the banking sector\", he pointed out, highlighting the importance of diversifying the financing mechanisms (capital market, etc.) to create better conditions that are conducive to growth. In this sense, he indicated that resorting to debt could also be based on the opportunities offered by active debt management operations, as well as by the opportunities for concessionary financing and the financing mechanisms available within the framework of international partnerships.

Consequently, the new development model insists on the need to adopt new strategic choices, based on the consolidation of achievements and the adoption of a break in certain areas, whether in terms of objectives or at least in terms of working methodology, which requires a change in mentalities and perceptions, he said. He noted that these choices touch on four points, namely the acceleration of the structural transformation of the national economy for the benefit of productive sectors that generate wealth and quality jobs that can provide resources to finance priority social sectors. For this, Benmoussa said that we must create an environment that spurs business and secures the interests of investors, in addition to improving the competitiveness of the national economy by reducing the costs of production factors, in particular those related to energy and logistics through fundamental reforms of the sectors concerned, in addition to directing investments towards promising productive sectors through the establishment of an appropriate incentive framework and wider and easier access of businesses to financing opportunities, especially for small businesses. Efforts should also be made to increase the capacity of the national economy to withstand crises, especially those of a systemic nature, such as the Coronavirus epidemic, which is likely to remain in the future, said Benmoussa, who underlined the imperative for certain balanced economic sectors such as agriculture, to include issues related to food sovereignty and sustainability among its priorities, as well as in sectors such as tourism, which calls for anticipating transformations which will be set by domestic and global demand.

In response to this situation, several measures have been put in place by the Ministry of Education, to ensure continuity through the experience accumulated in the process of digitization of the education-training system, notably the production of digital content, Amzazi explained. \"We have been able to ensure educational continuity and replace face-to-face school attendance by distance learning,\" he said during a ministerial roundtable meeting attended by Ministers of Education of several African countries including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Congo, and Tunisia. Another challenge for the Moroccan education system is the \"accessibility\" of digital content for many young people, especially in rural areas. \"To ensure fairness and equal opportunities, it was necessary to develop another method by producing content broadcast on television,\" the Minister noted. \"Today, after almost a year and a half, lessons learned are that the pandemic crisis has been a real catalyst for the digitalization process in Morocco,\" he said."}

In this sense, he highlighted the national migration policy, launched by HM King Mohammed VI and based on solidarity and human values, the African Agenda on Migration, presented by the Sovereign in 2018, as the Leader of Africa on the issue of migration, a flagship vision that gave birth to the African Migration Observatory, inaugurated in Rabat in December 2020, as well as the International Conference of Marrakech in 2018, which adopted the Global Pact. Noting that the discourse on migration can no longer be limited to economic migrants and refugees, Bourita said that \"there is another category, growing, of migrants on which all our attention must focus: climate migrants\". \"Natural disasters and global warming are, in fact, the main trigger for new internal displacements in the world,\" he insisted, adding that \"if the category of climatic migrants attracts our attention, it is not only because of its number, which could reach 200 to 250 million by 2050, but also because it is distinguished by its complexity\u201d. \"It is difficult to quantify accurately, as it is often based on predictions. It is difficult to qualify conceptually, because it blurs the boundaries between forced and voluntary migration - of which it is on the edge. It is the result of multiple factors that intertwine climate change with other economic, social and political factors,\" he added, noting that most of it is internal displacement or regional migration, as international migration is often inaccessible for the populations most vulnerable to climate change. Referring to the situation in the African continent, Bourita said that Africa, particularly impacted by climate change, \"is disproportionately affected by the phenomenon of climate and environmental migration,\" citing as an example the Sahel region, which remains one of the"}

As part of the actions aimed at reducing inequalities in education and contributing to the promotion of human capital, the INDH has led several interventions related to the field of education, including through its program 4: \"Boosting the human capital of rising generations\". Support for pre-school education is a major focus of this program, given the significant impact of pre-schooling, notably in the fight against school wastage, access to elementary school and overall improvement of the educational trajectory, which ultimately contributes to the improvement of the national index of human capital, increasing the average duration of schooling, noted the same source. The ambition of the INDH is to support the generalization of pre-school education, especially in disadvantaged rural areas.

Abdennabaoui also welcomed the \"tremendous\" efforts made by judges, clerks and executives of the registry office as well as lawyers to ensure the conduct of trials in full compliance with the preventive measures in force. This has allowed to hold more than 19,000 trials remotely in one year and to judge more than 370,000 cases. The First President of the Court of Cassation noted that the promulgation of a law regulating virtual trials gives \"beautiful hope\" for all those interested in the issue of justice, voicing hope that this text will become a reality in the future to endow the country with an appropriate legal mechanism for holding post-Covid remote trials.

For decades this has been one of the \"main weak points of what many have called the +Moroccan miracle+\", the media outlet said. However, on April 14, pursuant to what had been announced in July 2020, the Sovereign launched a \"far-reaching structural\" reform to overhaul the entire social protection system in the country, the media outlet noted. This reform is intended to improve a protection system that is \"not very generalized and not very generous\" through framework laws, notes the author of the article, who goes in detail over the different stages of its generalization. All these reforms should require annually, when they are implemented, a financial effort of 51 billion dirhams, or a little more than 4.7 billion Euros. The state budget will bear 23 billion (2.1 billion euros) of this total, i.e. 7% of budget expenditure in 2021. On the lessons to be learned from this \"mini-revolution\", the magazine underlines that Morocco has chosen to follow a \"middle and original path\" in between a developed Western Europe whose sophisticated \"welfare state\" weighs on its economic dynamism, and the major emerging countries whose obsession with catching up economically has largely made us forget the imperative of social progress and improvement of people's welfare. At a time when the inhabitants of the planet are dreaming of the post pandemic world, \"Morocco is one of the few nations who have seized the opportunity of this unprecedented change to engage in structural reforms without delay\", \"Slate\" concluded."}

Jorge Rachid stressed the importance of this \"expansion of rights of the social security system\" in Morocco with state funding, noting that in Argentina the system is funded by a combination of contributions from the state, on the one hand, and active workers and employers on the other. The academic praised this system of solidarity, which is based on three principles: those who earn the most contribute for those who earn the least; those who are younger contribute for those who are older; and those who are healthier support the sick. Detailing his country's experience in this area, Jorge Rachid said that compulsory health insurance must be protected by law so that it is not \"dithered over\" by medical providers and pharmaceutical companies. HM King Mohammed VI chaired on April 14 at the Royal Palace of Fez, the launching ceremony of the implementation of the project of generalization of social protection and the signing of the first related agreements.

The operation has also led to 195 arrests - 88 of for human trafficking and 63 on people smuggling charges. \"The remaining arrests were on other charges such as document fraud, theft, drugs-related crimes and environmental offenses,\" according to the same source. \"Morocco played a strong role in the operation by hosting the Operational Coordination unit and making 49 arrests, almost exclusively linked to migrant smuggling,\" INTERPOL added. Also, \"Spanish authorities acted on intelligence from Morocco, arresting two key smugglers known for facilitating the transport of irregular migrants from the African continent using rigid inflatable boats and lorries.\" \"This joint operation was supported by a number of partners, with the International Organization for Migration (OIM) playing a lead role in victim assistance. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime also provided judicial support, and intelligence was generated by AIRCOP, Europol and the AU-Horn of Africa Initiative on Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling,\" the organization explained. Operation Weka (STOP in Swahili) once again demonstrated how closely linked migrant smuggling and human trafficking are, particularly in a global health crisis. INTERPOL Secretary-General J\u00fcrgen Stock, quoted by the release, noted that \"these victims could not simply walk away from the horrific situation they found themselves in and the suffering they endured.\" \"This is why INTERPOL's work does not stop here.

This approach is in no way a devaluation or an underestimation of the national judiciary, insisted Zahrach, stressing that the Moroccan judiciary, in all independence and impartiality, has done what is necessary in this case. During this conference, organized under the theme \"The rights of victims, between sovereignty of justice, State of institutions and tendentious allegations\", the lawyer at the Rabat bar strongly condemned the remarks made by Monjib, presuming that the victims of Taoufik Bouachrine are the creation of a \"secret structure\". Zahrach further asserted that the statement of Maati Monjib are a senseless attack on the victims, a fact that has nothing to do with human values. He also underlined that the victims of Bouachrine are real victims who suffer martyrdom because of the sexual assault they experienced and its psychological, moral and material repercussions. The methods used against the victims of sexual assault, whether at the level of the Bouachrine case or others, \"discredit the national institutions, undermine the independence of the judiciary and cast doubt on the acts incriminated under the Moroccan criminal law and international laws\". During this conference, moving testimonies were given by many victims of sexual assault by Taoufik Bouachrine, in particular Asmaa Hallaoui and Na\u00efma Lahrouri, in addition to the testimony of Hafsa Boutahar who accuses journalist Omar Radi of sexual assault. They recounted their daily sufferings following these assaults, the repercussions on their professional, social and personal lives and their moral and material impact.

Based on data from the ONDH household panel survey and supplemented by field investigations, the study highlights the inequalities affecting women and girls in Morocco through the examination of several outcome indicators related to SDGs. It also highlights the causes of these inequalities, which are generally determined by underlying structural factors and often rooted in the country's economic, social and political institutions. Speaking at the webinar, Secretary-General of the ONDH, El Hassan El Mansouri, said that this study is unique since it focuses on inequalities among women, moving beyond the notion of considering women as a homogeneous and universal group. \"This study confirmed the heterogeneity among women according to different factors, notably place of residence, level of education, marital status and standard of living,\" El Mansouri added. Representative of UN Women in Morocco, Leila Rhiwi, stressed that the study analyzed inter-sectoral gender discrimination, noting that multiple forms of discrimination overlap and aggravate inequalities in general and among women in particular. \"The intersectional approach adopted to carry out this study identified those who are most marginalized, vulnerable and excluded to better guide public policies aimed at them and meet their needs and expectations,\" Rhiwi noted. Resident Coordinator of the United Nations in Morocco, Sylvia Lopez-Ekra, said that this study helped identify ''women who were left behind and those whose daily life has not changed despite the important advances Morocco made.'' The main findings of the study show that poorest rural women are twice as likely to marry before the age of 18 compared to rich counterparts from urban households (28.3% versus 13.9%), the prevalence of violence against women remains high (58% in urban areas and 55% in rural areas). This kind of violence is present in both private (52%) and public spheres (48%) and the most blatant shortcomings"}

On this occasion, US Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, Kelley Currie, stressed that partnership with local organizations is at the heart of the Women's Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) initiative because they \"have the local knowledge, know what needs to be done, can help to effectively intervene and identify the women who need what this program has to offer.\" It is critical \"to help women prosper in the workforce, access skills, training, and funds. Now more than ever, we need women to be leaders in the recovery of the economy\" impacted by the Covid-19 health crisis, she added. For her part, Charity Wallace, DFC Managing Director for Global Women's Issues said that the purpose of this round table is to identify opportunities for the DFC and the US government to invest in the economic empowerment of women in the MENA region and specifically in Morocco. \"We want to identify transactions through which we can invest in women as entrepreneurs, managers or employees, but also in products and services that benefit them,\" she told MAP. Concerning Morocco, the DFC also wants to \"identify opportunities for private sector inclusion,\" Wallace added. For her part, manager of Sustainable Industrial Zones Fund (Fonzid) at the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)-Morocco, Ikram El Houdali, noted that the fund works to implement initiatives that improve women's access to industrial zones through financing incubator initiatives, supporting small businesses, and funding vocational training programs and services, including transport and security. Women do not have access to the necessary knowledge and training in the creation of small businesses or access to credit and funds, she observed. Samira Mzibar, Gender and Social Inclusion Director at MCA-Morocco highlighted the importance of networking for building women's self-confidence. Through the 2X MENA initiative, the DFC will invest in solutions that provide economic opportunities for women"}

Risks in the workplace concern everyone, he pointed out, stressing that these can result either in work accidents or in the development of so-called occupational diseases. \"There is a need to increase our efforts to remedy the shortcomings and advance health and safety standards in our country,\" Chami underlined. He said, in this regard, that in Morocco, around 2,000 deaths per year are linked to work accidents according to the International Labor Organization, one of the highest figures in the Middle East and North Africa region. The CESE has carried out a study on the issue of health and safety at work. This study concerns both the public and private sectors with their various components, in particular very small businesses, the agricultural sector and the informal sector. The diagnosis carried out by the Council reveals that Morocco has made significant progress in the field of health and safety at work. These include the preparation of the draft framework law on health and safety at work, the creation of the National Institute for working conditions and the development of the national policy and the national health and labour safety program for the period 2020-2024. Despite these initiatives, major shortcomings persist, according to the CESE. These result, among other things, in a limited implementation of health and safety rules in the private sector, a non-inclusion of the system in the public sector and a lack of specialized skills. The CESE also reports the problem of governance of the health and labour safety system, the dispersion of responsibility for health and safety management between several actors, the limits of national legislation in the face of international standards and a weak social protection.

Adequate financial resources have been allocated to ensure that the operation is free of charge and that it is carried out in accordance with professional standards, he said.

The overwhelming majority of migrants (97.1%) do not invest in Morocco, the survey showed, noting that this trend is mainly the result of insufficient capital, complicated administrative procedures, and weak financial support and tax incentives. According to the HCP, more than four-fifths of Moroccan migrants have sent money to Morocco in the 12 months prior to the survey. This percentage varies little by gender and education level, but differs somewhat by age and host country. The survey reveals that two-thirds of current migrants' remittances are made through money transfer agencies, with Moroccan banks lagging far behind. The beneficiaries of remittances are parents first, followed by spouses and children. Nearly nine-tenths of remittances received are used for the regular expenses of households in Morocco. The survey targeting Moroccans Abroad and returning expatriates was conducted between August 2018 and January 2019 on a representative sample of 15,000 households, including 8,200 expatriates, 4,100 returning expatriates and 2,700 non-migrants.

The document was presented during a press conference on the occasion of the official launch of the international campaign \"16 days of activism against gender-based violence. It highlights the importance of the contribution of the State and its institutions in educating society on the dangers that may result from the marriage of minors. The document also advocates for a new holistic approach that takes into account the social and economic aspects of families in various regions of Morocco, particularly in rural and landlocked areas and also among needy and poor families in urban areas. On this occasion, Raji Lhoucine, president of the Ennakhil association - a member of the Dounia Collective - said that the marriage of minors with the Fatiha (without going through the written act) represents 10.79% of all marriages, according to the findings of a national study carried out by the association in 2019. According to data from the Ministry of Justice, 319,177 marriage permits for minors were granted between 2009 and 2018. \"Child marriage in general and of underage girls, in particular, has disastrous effects and consequences such as dropping out of school, early pregnancies, as well as domestic violence and child mortality,\" he said, quoting a 2015 World Bank study. The Dounia Collective includes ten associations from different regions of the Kingdom working for the protection of children and against the marriage of minors. The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is an annual international campaign that kicks off on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and runs until 10 December, Human Rights Day."}

He explained that in accordance with article 316 of the Commercial Code, \"any person, with full knowledge of the facts, who accepts to receive or endorse a check on the condition that it is not cashed immediately and that it is kept as a guarantee, is punished by imprisonment from one to five years and a fine of 2,000 to 10,000 MAD\". The demand for guarantee checks by private clinics is the result of the absence of an electronic system allowing access to the data available to insurance companies to know whether the patient is subscribed with a company or not, said the Minister, noting that this is a gap that is being exploited. According to him, the ministry interacts quickly with this kind of questions, complaints and grievances through an inspection system and in the event of infringement, the violators are sanctioned via the Order of Physicians. After stressing that what had happened in recent days at certain clinics should not be generalized to all establishments, Ait Taleb assured that the services of the ministry have not received until now complaints related to the demand for guarantee checks by private clinics."}

In this regard, El Otmani considered that the promotion of the rights of people with disabilities is a shared responsibility between all institutions and components of society, stressing that associations working in the field of disability are considered a fundamental player in the inclusion of people with disabilities. The associations have gone beyond their traditional missions of raising awareness to playing a pioneering role focused, in particular, on the proposals of ideas and innovative projects to the official entities concerned, as well as the contributions to be provided by various social services for the benefit of disabled people, in particular at the level of social protection institutions. El Otmani affirmed that the Constitution of 2011 takes a keen interest in people with disabilities, in particular in its article 34 stipulating that the public authorities develop and implement policies intended for people and categories with special needs. The Kingdom has always expressed its commitment to upholding and promoting the rights of people with disabilities, by ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its optional protocol on May 8, 2009, added El Otmani. The reforms launched by the government illustrate the choice of the country, in particular through the development of an integrated public policy aimed at promoting the rights of people with disabilities and the establishment of the special account entitled \"Social cohesion support fund\", for financing assistance services to people with special needs, he said, recalling the adoption of framework law n\u00b0 97.13 relating to the protection and promotion of the rights of people with disabilities."}

The study, which focused on the molecular and serological profile of patients admitted to Sheikh Khalifa International University Hospital in Casablanca, involved people discharged from hospital after completion of 10 days treatment, normalization of biological tests, clinical recovery and either two consecutive negative RT-PCR, or after 24 days of hospitalization. The document revealed that 18% of the recruited patients were asymptomatic while the remaining 82% presented one or more of the following symptoms: fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, chest pain, headache, sore throat, diarrhea and/or vomiting. According to the study, comparison between the serological and virological results showed that there is no correlation between the results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test after clinical recovery, and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies. This way, serological testing appears to be an interesting method that could be used to declare biological recovery for patients in whom the N gene persists in the RT-PCR, it added, saying that serological testing appears to be the most reliable diagnostic method in surveillance, comparing to RT-PCR because of its inability to detect past infection."}

This institution had published, on September 15, 2020, a press release defending the independence and inviolability of the judiciary, in response to certain international NGOs which, instead of contributing to the consolidation of this independence, are calling for putting pressure to undermine it, the same source recalled. The Moroccan justice is the only party responsible for the case of the person concerned, prosecuted for his alleged involvement in the perpetration of acts incriminated by the Moroccan criminal law, the public authorities insisted. These are acts punishable by legal measures and procedures that meet the requirements of a fair trial, the same source said. This legal action is in no way linked to the exercise by the person concerned of his job as a journalist. Only the Moroccan Press and Publishing Code is entitled to govern the latter's articles and investigations, knowing that the capacity of journalist does not exempt the person from legal proceedings, if the charges brought against the defendant constitute material and moral legal elements of a crime which falls under the public law, the statement explained. The public authorities categorically reject HRW's repeated attempts to take on roles unrelated to the defense of human rights, as in its latest publication which attempted to cast doubt on judgments, to exploit, in bad faith, the confidentiality of judicial investigations, and to influence the normal course of a judicial case which is at its very beginning. The Organization tried to present an image contrary to the case's ins and outs and misinterpreted legal and judicial texts and procedures without providing tangible legal or material evidence on the non-veracity of the criminal acts stated in the said case, an action that only the judiciary are entitled to take in all legal systems, the statement said.

Gender equality is transformational in that it crosses all the challenges of our time in a transversal way, he said, adding that its centrality lies in its multiplying power which makes it \"the barometer of progress and development.\" The commemoration of this anniversary is above all a moment of evaluation, in that \"the results are mixed\", he stressed. \"Certainly, significant efforts have been made. However, no country can claim to have achieved total equality. Discrimination still exists. Disparities remain.

The search operation and cartography carried out by the BCIJ officers and crime scene experts in the sites of intervention enabled the seizure of knives, electronic equipment and devices which will undergo the necessary expertise by the laboratory of analyzing traces and digital evidence, the statement said. According to the preliminary investigation, members of the terrorist cell, who were unable to join the \"ISIS\" camps in the Sahel region south of the Sahara, have decided to join dangerous and imminent terrorist projects that aim to destabilize the security and stability of the Kingdom through terrorist methods inspired by the operations that the organization was carrying out on the Syrian-Iraqi scene.

The site of the video recording of this \"allegiance\" was identified near the Beni Mekada neighborhood in Tangier, noted the BCIJ, underlining the existence on the premises of a mural painting similar to ISIS standard.

These adaptations concern the legal frameworks governing agricultural production (decree n\u00b0 2-13-359), agricultural and fishery inter-professional organizations (law n\u00b0 03-13), the agricultural aggregation (law n\u00b0 04-12) for inclusive aggregation projects, and legal frameworks governing the safety of food products and the protection of the quality of local organic products (Law No. 39-12), local origin and quality labels (law n\u00b0 25-06) and agricultural advice (law n\u00b0 58-12) to create the National Agency for Agricultural Advice (ANCA), noted the study. These legal reforms were accompanied by institutional reforms by government agencies and public interventions in the agricultural sector.

The creation of the Agricultural Development Agency (ADA) to promote private investment in the sector, the National Office for Food Safety (ONSSA) and the National Office of the Agricultural Council (ONCA) in charge of training and advisory services for producers is a perfect illustration of how institutional reform has helped to re-frame the division of tasks between state agencies and create an environment adequate for attracting additional private investment, said AfDB.

These measures, combined with good pre-crisis fundamentals, led to good resilience of the banking sector, with, at the end of 2020, an average solvency ratio of 15.7%, despite a decline in banking results of 43%. This resilience was confirmed by the results of the stress tests carried out by the banks and by BAM in the 2nd and 4th quarter of 2020. In terms of liquidity, the situation of the banks remained comfortable thanks to the measures taken by the Bank. In terms of banking supervision, the Bank had to adapt to the context of the health and economic crisis through monitoring priority sources of risk and increased attention to everything relating to customer protection."}

The climate and environmental emergency calls for immediate mobilization to avoid large-scale shocks likely to threaten the balances of natural ecosystems on a planetary scale which would in turn induce systemic impacts on human life at the health, social and economic levels, he said. In this context, BAM is investing at the international level to contribute to the actions by the network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), he said. At the national level, the Central Bank has initiated several projects aimed at setting up the bases of climate risk management at the level of banks and at promoting the role of the banking sector in the transition to green, environment-friendly finance. In addition, Jouahri indicated that during the year 2020, customer protection was at the center of Bank Al-Maghrib's concerns in the context of the crisis. Credit institutions have been called on to be more transparent and expeditious in the processing of requests for the deferral of guaranteed loans, he said, adding that several projects have also been initiated to improve the quality of the bank-customer relationship and promote greater banking competition. These projects are particularly related to the establishment of a comparator of bank tariffs and value dates as well as the operationalization of banking mobility and the issuance of releases of guarantees after repayment of the loan, said the governor of BAM."}

In some regions, the harvest obtained exceeded initial forecasts, particularly north of Oum Errabia. The 2020-2021 crop year is historically the second best campaign after that of 2014-2015 despite rainfall comparable to a normal campaign. This testifies to the technical progress made in the cultivation of cereals thanks in particular to the dissemination of genetic progress, the result of the use of certified seeds, the mechanization of cultivation operations and the introduction of new production and soil conservation technologies like direct sowing."}

{"title": "Morocco Has Experienced 'Relatively Stable' Growth in Recent Years (Govt. Report)", "content": "\"The growth rate no longer depends much on the volatility of agricultural activity that has been impacted by drought for years, especially in 2019,\" which reflects the development that several productive sectors have experienced, including automotive and aerospace industries, which have contributed to the stabilization of economic growth, the report noted. In 2019, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by 2.5%, after increases of 4.2% and 3.1% respectively in 2017 and 2018. This evolution is explained, on the one hand, by the decline in external demand addressed to Morocco and the slowdown in the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) in an international context marked by geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, this is due to the decline in agricultural value added of 5.8%, resulting in a contraction of income and domestic demand, especially with regard to the rural population. This decline was offset by the continued improvement in the value added of the non-agricultural sectors, which recorded an increase of 3.8% in 2019 compared to 2.9% in 2018. After an expected contraction of 6.3% in 2020, due to the health crisis related to the new coronavirus, the Moroccan economy is expected to grow by 5.3% in 2021, the document said, noting that the impact of the health crisis on Morocco's economic performance is relatively limited compared to other countries in the region. The document also stated that the national GDP has experienced a remarkable annual growth of 3.7% between 2007 and 2019, an overall growth exceeding 55%. Thus, several studies and international reports estimate that the growth will be more sustained thanks to the set of structural reforms that the country knows and the implementation of the new development model. As for inflation, the report indicated that over the past two decades, the average inflation rate has been kept below 2%. During the period 2017-2019, the inflation rate was less than 1%, the lowest in the region. It added that this relatively low rate contributes to the preservation of the purchasing power of families."}

These efforts have been accompanied by the creation of a new public investment management system, based on performance, efficiency and the mobilization of new and innovative sources of financing,\" the report said. Public investment contributes to stimulating the public order and consequently, to the creation of jobs in the private sector, the reinforcement of the competitiveness of the national economy, the improvement of the investment climate and the attractiveness of Morocco, and in a global way, the resilience of the national economic fabric. General budget investment loans have doubled since 2007, with investment efforts having been stepped up on an annual average basis with a budgeted amount of 73.6 billion dirhams during the period 2017-2021, compared to 56.6 billion dirhams between 2012-2016 and 42.9 billion dirhams between 2007-2011. Implementation rate of investment loans under the general state budget has improved significantly, rising from 53% in 2012 to nearly 79% in 2018, reflecting the state's efforts to improve the implementation of public investments and reduce payment times for public orders.

Water security requires a combination of mobilization of conventional and non-conventional water resources, whose cost is relatively high, demand management, rationalization and efficiency in the use of water and the fight against pollution, said the Ministry in a statement. According to projections made as part of the National Water Plan (PNE) 2020-2050, supplying the Kingdom with water in a sustainable manner requires a budget of about 400 billion dirhams, including 115.4 billion dirhams dedicated to the National Drinking Water Supply and Irrigation Program (PNAEPI) 2020-2027, which was launched by His Majesty King Mohammed VI on 13 January 2020. The World Bank Vice President for the Middle East and North Africa region, Ferid Belhaj, emphasized the centrality of water for development in Morocco. He also explained that the growing water scarcity aggravated by climate change, gives today's water issue a quasi-existential dimension. Morocco, which has already made great strides on the issue of sustainable water management, is ready to take its thinking further and show that sound water resource management can become the lever of a sustainable, resilient and inclusive development model."}

According to him, the launch, in this context, by HM the King, of the large industrial vaccine manufacturing project takes on the dimension of an emblematic initiative of these sovereign prerogatives. \"Its scope goes beyond its own objectives. It presents itself as if it were the model of what should be the content of the concept of economic sovereignty to which the Royal message associated it\", noted Lahlimi. Through the political and international diversity of the partners in the joint venture called upon to carry out this project, this concept, far from referring to a notion of self-sufficiency, is rather a call for public policies whose decision, always sovereign, should be part of an openness on the world and a consideration of regional solidarity and South-South relations, he said. \"In its operational dimension, this concept implies the return in force of the State. A State which is strong in its historical, popular and constitutional legitimacy. Always strategic. Always regulatory. But more resolutely developer.

In nominal terms, the gross domestic product should post an increase of 3.8%, said the same source, stressing that this development shows a slight increase in inflation, measured by the implicit index of GDP, of 0,9% instead of 1.5% in 2021. The national economic outlook for the year 2022 takes into account new trends in the international environment, in particular the global demand addressed to Morocco which should increase by nearly 6,7% in 2022 after 9.3% in 2021, said the HCP. It added that these forecasts also take into account the renewal of the budgetary policy in force in 2021 and an average cereal production during the 2021/2022 crop season. However, these prospects involve \"strong uncertainties\" mainly related to the evolution of the epidemiological situation and the outcome of the vaccination process at the national and international levels. On the basis of these assumptions, non-agricultural activities should post an increase in value added of nearly 3.6% in 2022 instead of 4.1% in 2021, attributable in particular to a continued recovery of the tertiary sector due to the recovery in market services, notably tourism, transport and commerce, due to the planned opening of borders in 2022."}

From June 15 to September 15, 2021, the company has scheduled some 315 weekly frequencies connecting Morocco to the five main countries where Moroccans around the world are concentrated (France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the United Kingdom) against 71 weekly frequencies in the summer of 2020. Thus, RAM offers 162 frequencies per week in France against 49 carried out in the summer 2020 season. It also schedules 76 weekly frequencies in Spain against 8 and 35 weekly frequencies in Italy against 8 in the summer of 2020. The direct Paris-Dakhla connection will be launched from June 18. Thanks to this new air route, the national company will connect, for the first time, the European continent (with the exception of the Canary Islands) to the city of Dakhla in less than 4 hours 30 minutes. One to two frequencies per week will be launched initially, says RAM, explaining that this new tourist route, initiated in partnership with the Moroccan National Tourism Office (ONMT) seeks to strengthen the strategic economic positioning of the region of Dakhla-Oued Eddahab, while helping to accelerate the revival of the tourism sector. \"Royal Air Maroc has always supported Moroccan tourism."}

Over the past decade, Morocco has improved its institutional, policy, and investment framework for disaster risk management. To build up its financial resilience as well, it launched a solidarity fund to alleviate the financial impact of natural disasters on households and businesses and design a set of instruments to reduce the State\u2019s financial exposure to risk. \"The focus of this new operation will be to strengthen the impact of risk reduction investments and enhance the monitoring and evaluation of investments,\" said Philipp Petermann, Disaster Risk Management Specialist and Task Team Leader. \"The program will accelerate results on the ground by building on reforms the Kingdom has been implementing with the support from the World Bank. It will also seek to promote a gender-inclusive approach to managing disaster risk,\" he noted. The parent program has contributed to strengthening the country\u2019s resilience to natural disasters already, with outcomes that include turning an emergency fund for post-disaster response into a national resilience fund that currently co-finances more than 150 strategic investments to reduce climate-related risks, ranging from flood protection infrastructure to early warning systems, hazard mapping and capacity building, the press release added. The parent program has also supported a national disaster risk management strategy, thus taking another step to fortify Morocco\u2019s institutional framework for disaster and climate-related risk management.

For example, in 2009, we set the goal of reaching 42 percent renewable energy capacity in 2020. Now the target is 52 percent capacity by 2030,\" he said. \"We believe that it is possible to reach the very ambitious objective of 100 percent because it has become economically possible. Before, it was limited by the intermittency of renewables, but that is not the case anymore,\" the official noted. \"We can reach 100 percent of renewables while eliminating also all use of fossil fuel for transport,\" he stressed. For the energy transition in transportation, the development of new technologies and hydrogen are essential, he said, adding that the hydrogen sector offers many opportunities to accelerate the energy transition and drastically reduce emissions. \"If we can produce green molecules\u2014hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and others\u2014for electricity needs while finding a way to decarbonize them, hydrogen technology can be applied to the transportation and industrial sectors,\" he asserted. In Morocco, there are many opportunities because the country has already achieved high renewable energy production, he said, adding that \"if you look at the map of Morocco for wind and solar projects, there is tremendous potential. Before, we were 95 percent dependent on fossil fuel imports, but not anymore due to renewable projects. This is a fundamental economic change and opportunity.\" With strong political support, we have led the successful development of global projects for ten years, he said. Morocco has shown the whole continent how to economically implement renewable energy policies, and we support our partners throughout the continent today in this pursuit. We can share with many countries our different projects on both small and large scales, he underlined."}

The NMD offers a transformative vision for the social contract, Hentschel said, noting that the novel coronavirus (covid-19) crisis was a fundamental breaking point that certainly contributed to this new vision. \"The State mobilized itself to protect Moroccan citizens and preserve their lifestyle. A mobilization which has helped strengthen the feeling of trust and belonging, and which today must be perpetuated and consolidated\", he added.

{"title": "CSMD: Series of Barriers Hinder Development Momentum (Official)", "content": "Speaking at a press conference to present the Committee's report, Benmoussa stressed that among these barriers is the lack of a comprehensive and long-term strategic vision, shared and assumed by public governance stakeholders. The second barrier lies in the slow structural transformation of the economy hindered by the lack of openness to new innovative and competitive players, he said, noting that these obstacles are associated with uncompetitive costs of factors of production and an inefficient regulatory system, and to unoptimized economic incentive mechanisms. The third obstacle involves the limited capacity of the public sector in the design and implementation of public policies and accessible and quality public services in areas essential to the daily life and welfare of citizens, Benmoussa explained. Similarly, the continued existence of a culture of compliance rather than a culture of leadership and performance in the administration leads to de-motivation and discourages initiatives and generation of ideas and projects. The fourth barrier stems from a feeling of insecurity and unpredictability that limits initiatives, due to a mismatch between some laws and social realities, a judiciary system that suffers from a lack of trust and strict bureaucracy, he noted. The bureaucratic burdens, the complexity of administrative procedures, and the high number of required authorizations hinder the entrepreneurial dynamic, he added. According to the CSMD President, these four barriers are also the result of cultural representations that enshrine monopoly as means of optimal management of development projects and consider that citizens, youth, private sector, and civil society are not sufficiently qualified to be stakeholders in the development.

In this regard, the Committee has made four recommendations, including the reform of the organization of the sector and the strengthening of transparency on the costs of the resource at every stage of its development, the report noted. It also involves the introduction of a pricing system that reflects the real value of the resources, the rationalization of its use and the management of its scarcity, it added, noting that a National Agency for Water Management (ANGE) will be established. This agency will replace the Interministerial Water Commission with a view to converging public and sectoral policies within a regional approach. The report noted that future water needs cannot be met without the mobilization of non-conventional resources and the preservation of groundwater resources. The Committee stressed the need to rationalize the use of groundwater, through exploitation methods that take into account the regeneration capacity of the phreatic zones. According to the same source, it will be appropriate to make extensive use of seawater desalination to provide a secure supplement to the water supply of coastal cities, to free up further water resources for irrigated areas and to significantly reduce water losses. Controlling the cost of energy and using appropriate pricing that maximizes the value of the resource can lead to an attractive niche for private investment and public-private partnerships, the Committee said. The treatment and reuse of wastewater and rainwater must take place to meet the needs of irrigated areas and relieve pressure on dams, which requires the establishment of a regulatory framework, in compliance with the World Health Organization's standards, it added."}

The report underscores the need to provide substantive responses to the structural constraints of Moroccan agriculture, by placing the issue of sustainability and development at the heart of the agricultural strategy, in particular through the optimization of water resources and the rationalization of agricultural energy consumption. The new development model also encourages the adoption of a strategy dedicated to the green economy, favoring the logic of a circular economy taking into account local specificities. Moreover, a special attention should be paid to the development of green industrial sectors in the areas of solar energy, wind power, liquid sanitation and waste management in order to anticipate future needs for skills in the development of green sectors, the report says.

The model also draws on the Kingdom's centuries-old history, which has forged the national identity and enriched it with multiple cultural tributaries, and establishes the Moroccan citizen as an autonomous actor who takes charge of his destiny. This historical depth, which founds the specificities of Morocco as a crossroads of civilizations and land of peace, dialogue and coexistence, also predisposes it to contribute actively to the construction of the new world. A world, shaken by the pandemic of the novel coronavirus (covid-19), whose post-crisis contours are just emerging on the horizon.

To ensure an optimal implementation of this project and a permanent commitment, said the CSMD Chairman, the report proposes two mechanisms to set this Development Model in motion, one of which is a National Pact for Development, which is meant to be a moment of consensus and commitment of the Nation's active forces around an ambition and a reference frame shared by all. This pact would be the tool for a renewal of the relationship between the State and development actors (political parties, constitutional institutions, private sector and social partners, territories and third sector), he said, adding that accountability, empowerment, subsidiarity, partnership, sustainability and inclusion are the keywords of this renewal. The National Pact for Development could be adopted in a solemn way by the concerned actors and constitute a strong moral and political commitment before His Majesty the King and the whole Nation, he noted, adding that this pact would pave the way for a new historical stage in the country's development path, as much in its symbolism as in its strategic vocation and functionality. The second mechanism recommended by the CSMD provides for the establishment, under the direct authority of His Majesty the King, of a tool to monitor the new development model. By ensuring overall coherence and strategic alignment, this mechanism will hold stakeholders accountable and enhance impact for citizens, while creating a synergy that transcends the duration of government mandates for broad mobilization in the context of consensus, he said."}

In terms of strengthening SMEs and entrepreneurship, the note proposes the establishment of a structuring framework favorable for the development of entrepreneurship and formal and informal SMEs. This involves the setting up in the short term of a technical support system for entrepreneurship including SMEs affected by the crisis, the structuring of support for entrepreneurship and SMEs on the medium-term, the adoption of an incentive framework for the formalization of the informal sector and the strengthening of the information system of SMEs. Regarding the fostering of the access of SMEs to the market, to public procurement and to internationalization, the study proposes a reform of the national public procurement system to promote access of small and medium-sized enterprises to public procurement and to increase the access opportunities of Moroccan SMEs to international markets in general, and to the African one in particular. The AfDB and the ILO also recommend the generalization and densification of access by SMEs to external financing, through the continuation of facilities for access to financing for micro-enterprises in the context of Covid-19, the facilitation of access to financing for formal and informal micro-enterprises by strengthening microfinance institutions. It also concerns supporting the bodies responsible for the financial education of SMEs (professional associations and chambers) and improving the financing of formal SMEs and start-ups.

Regarding export markets, the document emphasizes the prospects for Europe by 2028, according to two hypotheses. The first targets 10% of the medical cannabis market ($ 4.2 billion out of a total of 42), while the second hypothesis concerns 15% of the market, that is 6.3 billion dollars and agricultural revenues of 630 million dollars. In addition, these studies show that the European market will be targeted in the first place, in particular because of the ease of penetration and taking into account factors linked to consumption forecasts and the volume of imports. At the legislative level, the priority markets for Moroccan medical cannabis are Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Germany, with forecasts of 25 billion dollars/year by 2028.

During this meeting, the Board analyzed the evolution of the national and international economic and social situation as well as the macroeconomic forecasts of the Bank over the medium term. These forecasts reflect a moderate revival of optimism, particularly prompted by the smooth progress of the anti-Covid-19 vaccination campaign and the favorable climatic conditions prevailing in the current crop year. Thus, the national economy would grow by 5.3 percent in 2021. The growth rate would consolidate to 3.2 percent in 2022, according to BAM forecasts. \"The value-added of non-agricultural activities would increase by 3.5 percent in 2021 and, assuming a projected cereal production of around 95 million quintals, the value-added of the agricultural sector would rebound by 17.6 percent, thus bringing the growth of the national economy to 5.3 percent,\" the Central Bank explained.

Sales volumes were down mainly in Asia, particularly in India, where measures put in place to limit the spread of the pandemic have led to a decrease in local fertilizer production. Phosphate fertilizers turnover increased by 12%, despite the fall in prices. This increase was mainly due to higher export volumes, driven by strong demand, particularly in India and Brazil. The statement also notes that the group has been able to rely on the efficiency of its sourcing strategy, which has been further helped by the general decline in sulfur and ammonia prices in 2020. Sulfur prices were impacted by high inventory levels in China and increased production capacity, particularly in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Ammonia prices followed the same downward trend due to the ramp-up of new production capacities in the United States, Russia and Indonesia. \"OCP achieved significant growth in 2020, a year marked by an unprecedented economic environment.

{"title": "Inflation at \"Relatively\" Contained Levels in 2021 (HCP)", "content": "The upward trend in oil prices noticed since last February (+12.7%), associated with the rebound in the prices of imported agricultural commodities, would, however, be likely to accelerate the rate of growth of inflation in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter, said the HCP in a note on the evolution of consumer prices during the year 2020 and its outlook during the first half of the year 2021, taking into account the impact of an upward reversal in the prices of oil and other raw materials, particularly agricultural ones, on the international market. The note also highlighted that the increases in the prices of edible oils and other food products such as cereals are due to the increase in the prices of raw materials on the international market. It added that the consumption expenditure for edible oil represents 1.7% of the overall index and that for bread and cereals 7.07%. At the end of February 2021, the world price of sunflower and soybean oil rose, respectively, by 9.2% and 25.8%, instead of +11.2% and +9.4% during the whole year of 2020. The price of maize has increased by 40.9%, against -2.7% in 2020 and that of wheat by +13.6%, instead of +7.8% for the whole of 2020. Rising commodity prices are likely to include red meat, noted the HCP, adding that nearly 87% of animal feed and fattening is made up of corn, barley and soybean, products imported from abroad. Eggs and white meats are also likely to suffer the consequences of this increase in raw materials because, like the red meat industry, poultry feed depends mostly on imported composite products. However, inflationary risks \"would remain limited in the short term\", said the HCP, indicating that the rise in the prices of imported raw materials would be somewhat attenuated by the appreciation of the dirham against the dollar (-6.3% in January 2021, instead of -1.3% in 2020).

Morocco is not a party to this case but the victim of a legal guerrilla war orchestrated by Algeria and the polisario against its trade agreements with Europe. In their pleadings, the lawyers of the EU supported by those of the French government and the Moroccan confederation of agriculture and rural development (COMADER) immediately stripped the polisario of any legal capacity and any legal status to litigate before the courts of the European Union. Relying on the jurisprudence of the European Court itself, they considered that previous rulings have settled this issue by specifying that polisario was not entitled, under European and international law, to challenge, before the courts, the treaties duly concluded by the European Union with its various partners. The fact that the polisario is taking part in talks under the aegis of the UN as part of the political process to settle the Sahara conflict, does not grant it any quality or international legal status, they explained. Pointing out that the whole argument of the polisario is based on a wrong postulate, the EU lawyers specified that the latter is not the representative of the Sahrawi population as it claims and is therefore not related in any way to these agreements. In December, the European Commission confirmed that the agricultural agreement between the EU and Morocco which entered into force on July 19, 2019, was properly implemented, which resulted in real benefits for the Southern Provinces, even in times of the Covid-19 crisis. In its first Assessment Report of the Agreement, the EC had said it has allowed the emergence of a new dynamic and positive and constructive dialogue in the mutual interest of both partners.

This policy should also be turned towards the many countries of Europe which will probably wish in the future to establish \"closer\" trade links with the countries of the southern neighborhood, including Morocco and the countries of North Africa, explained the WB representative of in Morocco. According to the official, the recovery plan, which will mobilize nearly 11% of GDP in the form of fiscal stimulus measures, financing guarantees and capital injections into companies, is comparatively much \"more ambitious\" than the answer noted in emerging and developing economies, which does not exceed an average of 6% of GDP. In the implementation of this recovery plan, Hentschel considered that it is important to take into account several criteria for a successful \"economic rescue\" policy, in order to be able to establish economic choices and trade-offs. As such, with regard to the rescue of companies, it would be important to distinguish between companies which faced, because of the crisis, liquidity problems but remained solvent, from those whose survival will depend on fundamental changes to improve their competitiveness after the crisis. Regarding the reform component, Morocco is ahead of many other countries that are still in the process of mitigating the short-term impacts of Covid-19. The authorities saw this crisis as an opportunity to initiate important reforms to get the economy back on track, streamline the functioning of the state and strengthen the resilience of the most vulnerable categories, he said. The creation of the Mohammed VI Fund in particular could become \"a fundamental pillar\" to allow promising companies to capitalize, to grow and to create jobs.

Economic activity in the MENA region is forecast to recover modestly to 2.1% in 2021, the source says, adding that the recovery is contingent on containment of the pandemic, stabilizing oil prices, no further escalation of geopolitical tensions, and the assumption of a vaccine rollout in the second half of the year. \"By 2022, after two years of expected recovery, output is still about 8% below the output projected prior to the pandemic, with a larger impact on oil importers than exporters,\" it notes.

Although primarily targeting West Africa, the presence of Moroccan companies in Africa seems to have become more diversified in recent years.

In this uncertain context, we expect real GDP to contract by 6.3% in 2020, and to return to its pre-pandemic level only in 2022,\" Diaz Cassou said at a round-table discussion dedicated to the presentation of the \"Morocco Economic Monitor - From relief to recovery\" report. According to him, the COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly interrupted more than two decades of sustained socio-economic progress in Morocco. \"In 2020 the country will suffer its first recession since mid-1990s, and the economic contraction registered in the second quarter is the largest on record,\" he observed. For the economist, this is the result of the combined supply, demand and external shocks triggered by the pandemic, but also of the effects of adverse weather conditions on agricultural output. The crisis is having a severe impact on jobs and household incomes, generating a spike in unemployment and a deterioration of poverty and vulnerability indicators, he added. Diaz Cassou pointed out that in much of the world, the current crisis will lead to a considerable increase in indebtedness that could increase to 7.8% of GDP in 2020 while public debt could reach 76% of GDP. Despite the severity of the crisis, Morocco is better placed than other emerging economies to weather this storm thanks to the credibility of its macro-fiscal framework, to its relatively large external buffers and to its good access to international financial markets, said the economist, co-author of the report.

In the short run, using all available policy space to inject liquidity and equity into the private sector is still essential to prevent liquidity problems from turning into a wave of corporate insolvency. With a longer-term perspective, Morocco could stimulate competition and level the playing field for new entrants in goods and services markets, while upgrading its human capital and institutional frameworks, according to the survey conducted among 1,000 companies before and after the outbreak. In addition, appropriate industrial policies would help consolidate Morocco's position as a nearshoring destination for multinational companies and thus to take advantage of the strategic opportunities that could emerge globally in the post-pandemic world, WB explained. The survey 's findings included in WB's report \"Morocco Economic Monitor - From relief to recovery\" provides new evidence on the large and persistent impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the formal private sector.

After two years of sharp decline due mainly to drought and poor rainfall, a recovery of agricultural value-added is expected for Morocco, he continued, adding that these forecasts also take into account the announcements made by the Moroccan authorities regarding the vaccination plan. Prior to these announcements, the expected growth rate was 3.3%, the economist said. Over the medium term, growth is expected to pick up gradually, but the pace and length of that recovery are subject to high uncertainty, according to the report. The post-pandemic economic recovery is projected to be protracted, with real GDP only returning to the pre-pandemic trend, at the earliest, by 2022, it added. According to WB, tourism is projected to recover at a slower rate as concerns about subsequent waves of COVID-19, as well as reduced household incomes and savings. \"We expect the pandemic to widen the fiscal deficit and drive up public debt in both 2020 and 2021.

The circumstances prevailing in recent months have discouraged many citizens from taking the step and seizing this last opportunity, Boulaknadel added. The spontaneous regularization operation allows individuals of Moroccan nationality and legal entities with a tax residency in Morocco, holding assets and cash abroad, to regularize their situation vis-\u00e0-vis the Exchange Office and the Tax Administration.

The 2020 report on the benefits for the population of the Moroccan Sahara, issued on Thursday, confirms the important gains achieved by the Kingdom, part of its strategic partnership with the EU. Although the publication of this report remains a routine exercise, it nevertheless brings a stinging discredit to the false claims by separatists on the natural resources of the Moroccan Sahara. The recognition by the EC of the real benefits of this agreement for the population of the region defeats the spurious theories of the polisario and its relays about a so-called plundering of these resources. It also confirms that the model promoted in the Southern provinces sets development as a priority. The European body emphasizes that Morocco's Southern Provinces have become a real \"economic hub\" linked to important partners such as the EU, Russia, and sub-Saharan Africa. The EU report also highlights the significant efforts made by Morocco to attract investments as well as the projects carried out as part of the 2016-2021 development program for the Southern provinces. This is yet another recognition of the importance of the sustainable public investments undertaken and a confirmation of the EU's support for the reform and structuring projects undertaken by the kingdom in these regions (seawater desalination, the Dakhla Wind Farm, and so on). The EC report also reflects Morocco's serenity regarding the implementation of the agreement and the seriousness of its approach with regard to the commitments taken by both parties."}

He has played an important proactive role in international debates, for example by organizing two Cop of the 25 which have already taken place,\" said the European ambassador, whose mission is to convince foreign partners to engage in the fight against climate change. The Kingdom is also \"a forerunner in renewable energy\", he said, noting that the country has set itself ambitious goals for 2030 and that it is \"on the right track\". Commenting the prospects for partnership with the EU in these areas, as underlined in the joint declaration adopted on the occasion of the 14th session of the Association Council in June 2019, Vanheukelen noted that Morocco could become a major partner of Europe and a major player in renewable energies as well as in the future development of hydrogen. \"The Kingdom already has an electricity connection with Spain. You are an exporter of electricity to the European Union. I believe that this could develop even more and a partnership in terms of sustainable development between Morocco and the European Union could well take shape,\" he pointed out. \"We have to share experiences and know-how. This way Europe and Morocco can have a win-win collaboration\", he underlined in this regard. Regarding the achievement of climate objectives by EU member states, the European Ambassador recalled that the European summit last week allowed the establishment of a strategy to achieve a reduction in at least 55% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

Three developing countries are among the top ten in the ranking published on December 7, namely Morocco (7th), Chile (9th) and India (10th). This year's index paints a mixed picture of the climate action in the EU, which now stands at a crossroads. Scandinavian EU countries, Portugal and the EU as a whole rank high on the index with relatively good indicators. However, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic stand out as laggards on climate progress within the bloc. Quoting Stephan Singer, Senior Advisor, Global Energy Policies of Climate Action Network, the portal notes that many smaller nations like Portugal, Morocco, Chile and others in Europe perform much better. Overall, greenhouse gas emissions have increased slightly, but are actually falling in more than half of the countries (32) surveyed. In two-thirds of the countries (38) more than 10% of the total primary energy required now comes from renewable sources and in twelve countries renewables account for more than 20%.

Although agriculture is the main provider of jobs in Morocco, with nearly 38% of the total, the country\u2019s rural population accounts for 79.4% of its poor. To bring youth into farming, the program will finance entrepreneurship and training programs targeting rural youth, including women, and seeks to attract private investment into the agri-food sector by lifting regulatory and financing barriers to stimulate job creation. \u201cYoung people in rural areas represent an untapped potential for agricultural development. Creating opportunities for them is critical to foster the development of a modern agriculture and food sector, that can bring jobs and prosperity to rural areas. The program will nurture a culture of entrepreneurship and provide young people in rural areas with the tools and knowledge to use more sustainable and modern practices and technologies, hence contributing to a more climate resilient agriculture and food sector,\u201d said David Treguer, senior agriculture economist and co-task team leader. Morocco is coming to rely more heavily on digital transformation to reduce the harmful effects of climate change on its fragile resources of water and land. The program will pursue the efforts initiated under the country\u2019s previous agricultural development strategy, Plan Maroc Vert, to transition toward climate resilient agriculture that in future will be able to mitigate the impact of severe droughts. \u201cThe shift to digital technologies will move the sector from resource-intensive agriculture toward precision farming, helping it respond as much to the demands of market competition as to the challenges of adapting to climate change,\u201d said Maria Claudia Pachon, senior digital development"}

The Index is published by Germanwatch, NewClimate Institute and the Climate Action Network. Two other developing countries are also among the top ten in the ranking: Chile (9th) and India (10th).

They are among the highest carbon polluters and the highest energy consumers. None of them have any useful federal climate policy in place to reduce carbon pollution. That shows the influential power of the fossil fuel industries in these countries.

Morocco now enjoys this major advantage enabling it to provide its operators and investors with clean energy at very competitive costs, he added. \"Although our renewable energies are among the most competitive in the world, a deeper integration of our industry will also require generating competitive and decarbonized energy,\" the minister underlined, recalling that Morocco's industry created more than 500,000 jobs between 2014 and 2019. With its wind and solar potential, Morocco is well equipped to host large production capacity as part of a complementarity approach that would allow Europe to strengthen its industrial power and Morocco to buttress its position as an industrial base offering its European partners a pool of competitiveness and decarbonized productivity, the minister said. Held on December 1-3, the World Ptx Summit 2020 is a joint effort between the Moroccan Research Institute for Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN) and the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P), aiming towards the creation of a regional platform, dedicated to Green Hydrogen and its applications within the whole \"Power-To-X\" (Ptx) economy. This platform will trigger high-level discussions and partnerships for a new clean energy era, enabled by the Green Hydrogen opportunities The event is a must-attend event for policy-makers, industry leaders, research experts and global innovators to discuss PtX in-depth in a variety of high-level panels and sessions. More than 2,000 people from some 60 countries on five continents have already confirmed their participation in this international summit."}

This project, which will require an overall investment of $ 2.5 billion, has the potential to generate more than 400 highly skilled jobs over its lifetime, he said, noting that Soluna plans to set up a local centre of excellence developing expertise in blockchain technology, accessible to a growing global market. He also noted that this project complies with the High Guidelines of HM King Mohammed VI to promote the resources of the southern provinces. Belizaire underlined that the Sovereign, in his recent speech on the occasion of the commemoration of the Green March, said that this zone which is full of resources and potentialities, on land and sea, will thus serve as a bridge and link between Morocco and its African depth. In this regard, it is important to invest in maritime areas, both for the desalination of seawater and for the exploitation of renewable energy of wind or tidal origins\"."}
