It was a year ago that both sides massed units at the border in the Galwan Valley and eastern Ladakh near the poorly demarcated Line of Actual Control (LAC). In the months that followed India and China moved in tanks and constructed facilities for their respective forces to endure the long, cold winter. Now the early summer temperatures in the region have risen and so too have tensions between New Delhi and Beijing. The two nations battled in the Himalayas in 1962, but in the decades that followed India's strategic focus has primarily been with its rival Pakistan. However, after last year's brief\u2014albeit deadly\u2014encounter between Indian and Chinese soldiers, New Delhi has shifted that focus. According to reports from Indian media and Bloomberg, there are now some two hundred thousand Indian troops deployed along the border\u2014an increase of more than forty percent from last year. As many as fifty thousand were deployed in just the past week, and where the past military presence along the border was aimed largely at blocking a Chinese invasion, this build-up could allow India the opportunity to attack and even seize territory should it take on an \u201coffensive defense\u201d strategy.

But the real power of the Feilong-2 at this moment is its marketing value.

In response to record-breaking wildfires, the Governor announced that California must accelerate its goal of reaching 100 percent green electricity by 2045. And on September 23, as dark smoke infiltrated our lungs and millions of acres burned, the Governor issued an executive order, requiring the sale of all new cars to be zero-emission by 2035.

TRENDING: See people clinging to U.S. jets leaving Afghanistan disaster For this reason, we reluctantly offer our strong opposition to the Democratic Party\u2019s recently announced policy position that would eliminate future energy development on federal lands. Any policy which restricts U.S. energy supplies is anti-family, and will increase the already smothering financial pressure on those living on low or fixed incomes, or even worse, without incomes as a result of the pandemic. Energy produced on federal lands in western states generates revenue for state, county and tribal governments that fund essential government services such as healthcare, education and infrastructure. In CEA\u2019s view, the platform as currently written includes unrealistic cost and job-creation assumptions, and fails to recognize the critical role that a robust and expansive energy policy must play in helping the U.S. recover from the COVID-19 crisis. It also appears to ignore the fact that some of our federal lands hold our greatest resources of oil and gas as well as the critical minerals we need to build advanced renewable technologies. One of COVID-19\u2019s greatest \u2013 and perhaps least obvious \u2013 lessons is that the U.S. needs more energy, not less. It may seem counter-intuitive when we see headlines about low natural gas and oil prices or electricity demand hitting a 16-year low because of the dramatic consumption decline caused by the pandemic, but harnessing America\u2019s energy resources and technological know-how has never been more important. Case in point: One worry we never had throughout this pandemic is having enough reliable, affordable energy. We owe that to America\u2019s energy sector,"}

He said Thursday night the global crisis would have been prevented \"or at least mitigated\" if not for a cover-up by Chinese officials.

President Trump this week said he could not yet talk about possible \"repercussions\" for China's behavior. Hannity distilled the facts: When Chinese doctors tried to warn the world about the danger of coronavirus, they were silenced by their own government and many of those doctors now are dead. Further, in Wuhan, China, where the virus began, city officials held a \"massive potluck dinner\" after the danger was known. It is \"incomprehensible how dumb that is,\" Hannity said. He said the World Health Organization, a \"corrupt and frankly useless organization,\" contributed by carrying water for the Chinese communists at the time. The organization claimed Jan. 14 there was no clear evidence the virus could be transmitted from human to human. That's even though the pandemic was fully underway at the time, with the first known case in the United States Jan. 21.

TRENDING: See people clinging to U.S. jets leaving Afghanistan disaster The U.K.'s Christian Institute called the idea \"highly disturbing.\" Dr. Gordon Macdonald, chief executive of the Care Not Killing organization, said, \"Very quickly the argument moves from that of personal autonomy to doctors and nurses making value judgments about the quality of other people's lives while seeking to save money and tackle so-called 'bed blocking' in health services.\" The abstract for the report states there are three \"economic\" arguments in favor of \"assisted dying.\" First, allowing people to die in that way lets them \"avoid negative quality-adjusted life years.\" Then there is the fact that \"the resources consumed by patients who are denied assisted dying could instead be used to provide additional (positive) quality-adjusted life years for patients elsewhere in the healthcare system who wish to continue living and to improve their quality of life.\" And, the two authors say, \"organ donation may be an additional potential source of quality-adjusted life years in this context.\" They contend \"denying assisted dying is a lose-lose situation for all patients.\" In the Christian Institute report, Macdonald cited the assisted suicide laws in Oregon and Washington, where \"a majority of those ending their lives cite fear of being a burden on their families and finances.\" \"We have also seen cancer patients denied life-saving and life-extending treatments due to their cost but offered the drugs to end their lives,\" he explained.

Health Minister Olivier Veran, who is also a neurologist, tweeted Saturday, \"Taking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone, ...) could be an aggravating factor of the infection.\" His concerns stemmed from some French COVID-19 patients experiencing severe side effects because of the over-the-counter drug, NPR reported. A commentary published in The Lancet medical journal also stirred questions about ibuprofen's safety by hypothesizing how various medications could increase the risk of coronavirus infection. According to the commentary's author, taking ibuprofen might increase the number of ACE2 receptors on a cell, making someone more vulnerable to infection. Rachel Graham told NPR that even if people have low levels of ACE2, they are still susceptible to the virus. When asked about the study, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeir told reporters in Geneva that experts were \"looking into this to give further guidance,\" according to Science Alert . \"In the meantime, we recommend using rather paracetamol, and do not use ibuprofen as a self-medication.

What started as a few confirmed cases in the United States has turned into over 100 suspected infections , all being monitored by the CDC. Although originally painted as an illness that only posed a danger to the elderly and those who are already sick, the latest data from China show nearly a quarter of those infected end up as a \"severe\" case or dead. With the coronavirus outbreak still in its infancy, more time is needed to get a handle on how deadly this pathogen really is. While the official numbers from the Chinese government remain high, there is speculation that the communist regime is either suppressing the true totals or is woefully unprepared for an epidemic of this scale. Considering the long incubation time and possible lack of symptoms, it's likely that many in China have the virus and are not even aware.

That\u2019s one truth regular listeners to the conservative radio host are well aware of, and it\u2019s one that comes to mind immediately on reading a Twitter thread posted by Levin on Monday morning. Liberals were still celebrating a conveniently timed story posted by The New York Times on Sunday night, just as the second day of President Donald Trump\u2019s defense in his Senate impeachment trial was due to begin. But in a point-blank Twitter post that sounded like a conclusion to one of his own well-reasoned radio lectures, Levin asked one bottom-line question. \u201cIf every word of this New York Times story is true, which I doubt as it\u2019s another politically timed leak, how does this change anything?\u201d Levin wrote.

Liberals in the media, Democrats in the Senate and Bolton\u2019s publishers could not have asked for better timing.

Levin then dealt with the story from the standpoint few Americans share: An author of political works written for a mainstream market. It's the kind of point-by-point breakdown that carries special weight coming from someone intimately involved in the writing and publishing process.

The sooner the disease is identified, the greater a patient\u2019s prognosis and chances of recovery. With this in mind, a new, simple blood test currently being developed in the United Kingdom may be a significant game changer in the fight against breast cancer. Researchers believe the test will be capable of detecting breast cancer up to five years before any actual clinical signs or symptoms show themselves. The test works by identifying the body\u2019s natural immune responses to tumor cell-produced substances. Cancer cells produce harmful proteins in the body called tumor-associated antigens. These antigens in turn trigger the immune system to create antibodies to fight the proteins, called autoantibodies. Recently, scientists at the University of Nottingham established that these tumor-associated antigens, or (TAAs), can be used as accurate indicators of a developing tumor in its early stages. So, they identified and indexed a group of TAAs that are specifically produced by breast cancer, and designed a blood test that will look to detect these TAAs within samples taken from patients.

Solomon explained Biden \"insists that, in spring 2016, he strong-armed Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor solely because Biden believed that official was corrupt and inept, not because the Ukrainian was investigating a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, that hired Biden's son, Hunter, into a lucrative job.\" However, Solomon reports that hundreds of pages \"of never-released memos and documents \u2014 many from inside the American team helping Burisma to stave off its legal troubles \u2014 conflict with Biden\u2019s narrative.\" The documents raise the \"troubling prospect\" that U.S. officials may have provided false information about Ukraine \"that helped ease Burisma\u2019s legal troubles and stop prosecutors\u2019 plans to interview Hunter Biden during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\" He noted for example that Burisma\u2019s American legal representatives met with Ukrainian officials just days after Biden forced the firing of Shokin and offered an apology for dissemination of false information by U.S. representatives and public figures' about the Ukrainian prosecutors, according to the Ukrainian government's official memo of the meeting.

The New York Times described Thunberg's trip as \"a 15-day sail that was obsessively tracked by European news media, cheered by fellow climate activists, [and] mocked by critics.\" A few weeks later, Thunberg made her U.N. debut with more media coverage than even the President of the United States received.

At least that's what Sverre Lodgaard, a former deputy member of the Nobel award committee seems to think. Speaking to Reuters, Lodgaard said, \"The problem is that the principle of 'flight shame' brings her chances ... down. Shame is not a constructive feeling to bring about change,\" Business Insider reported. If you haven't heard of flight shame, don't worry. You haven't missed out on another fun environmentalist fad. The flight shame movement (or flygskam in Swedish) aims to reduce pollution by reducing air travel and to reduce air travel by shaming those who -- you guessed it -- travel by air. The movement started in Sweden, Thunberg's home country. According to the BBC , flygskam is a movement that \"suggests that people should feel embarrassed or ashamed to take planes because of the negative impact they have on the environment.\" Thunberg's solar yacht trip to the United States was viewed by some as a form of flight-shaming . And that, for Lodgaard, is where the rubber meets the road. The committee may pass by Thunberg because her tactics aren't sufficiently \"constructive.\" Talk about irony. Climate change activism often offers little in the way of constructive solutions."}

The audits then would go to the House Judiciary and Government Oversight committees. Meadows, a member of the oversight panel, said, \"It's time for Congress to act to restore this key oversight provision.\" Part of the concern is that the foundation for the special counsel's investigation has been undermined. It turns out that fired FBI director James Comey gave government documents to a friend to give to a reporter in the hope that it would prompt a special counsel probe. The documents were memos of Comey's behind-closed-doors meetings with the president when he was still director of the bureau. Further, a Democratic-funded \"dossier\" of claims Comey himself describe as \"salacious and unverified\" was crucial to the FBI's acquisition of a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.

On the flip side, Trump's immigration stance did not cause him to lose as many Romney voters as he gained. Therefore, the immigration issue likely played a key role in catapulting Trump into the White House. James G. Gimpel, professor of government at the University of Maryland and the author of the analysis, acknowledged immigration is an issue that now polarizes Americans along party lines more than at any time in contemporary history. Yet when Gimpel controlled for party identification, he found attitudes toward immigration did indeed drive voters to support Trump. The same was true when Gimpel controlled for sex, age, race, ethnicity, income and education. TRENDING: See people clinging to U.S. jets leaving Afghanistan disaster The author estimated that 90 percent of voters with the most conservative (meaning restrictionist) views on immigration voted for Trump in 2016. This was unsurprising, given that Trump made immigration restriction a central focus of his campaign. Meanwhile, in 2012, only 70 percent of those same voters voted for Romney, who kept his immigration views mostly quiet on the campaign trail.

If a consumer buys the imported product that is subject to the tariff, the consumer might pay the tax or tariff (if the producer adds the cost to the purchase price).

Perhaps Abraham Lincoln said it best: \"And again, by the tariff system, the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods\u2026 By this system, the man who contents himself to live upon the products of his own country, pays nothing at all.

It would be even better to base their schedules around days that God Himself has said are important. And reorienting their lives this way would prevent believers from ever going off track again. Such a dramatic, life-changing, faith-strengthening reboot is now possible, thanks to the work of Pastor Mark Biltz. In his newest book, \"God's Day Timer: The Believer's Guide To Divine Appointments,\" Biltz presents astounding new insights into the Bible, the divine feast days and what we know about when Jesus Christ will return. At the center of this remarkable message is the importance of Passover, a holiday deeply important to the Jewish people. As Biltz points out, Jesus died on Passover. Because most believers do not use the biblical calendar, they are celebrating Easter on the wrong day.

TRENDING: See people clinging to U.S. jets leaving Afghanistan disaster The notion is timely because there has been a mosque-building boom in America ever since Sept. 11, 2001.

And those are only the ones we know of, because many apply at city hall as cultural or community centers, Lugo told WND. Why the boom since 9/11? According to Robert Spencer , the New York Times bestselling author and director of Jihad Watch, 9/11 \"was a great victory for Islamic supremacists, because they were able to use it to portray all opposition to Muslim Brotherhood mosques and Shariah initiatives in the U.S. as 'backlash' and 'Islamophobia,' and clueless dhimmis who were anxious to show they weren\u2019t 'racist' or 'bigoted' fell into line.\" \"Free people in a few cities opposed Muslim Brotherhood mosques, as well they should have.

Many independent security experts said there was little way to know the true origins of the attacks. Sadly, the JAR, as the Joint Analysis Report is called, does little to end the debate. Instead of providing smoking guns that the Russian government was behind specific hacks, it largely restates previous private-sector claims without providing any support for their validity.

Until several months ago, Islamic State fought bloody battles with local Taliban units over fighters and territory in several provinces. The long-running Taliban insurgency has sought to stamp out its smaller rival, which only emerged in 2014. Afghan and U.S.-led coalition forces took advantage of the conflict, engaging the militants on multiple fronts to push them back and reclaim territory they held. But recently, Afghan officials say, the two insurgencies have worked out local deals to stop fighting each other and turn their sights on the government. The upshot is that Islamic State has been able to focus on fighting U.S.- backed Afghan forces in Nangarhar province and shift north into Kunar province, establishing a new foothold in a longtime Taliban and former al Qaeda stronghold.

The extension, known as Coincidence Detector, identified suspected or confirmed Jews by adding triple parentheses to their names wherever they were referenced online. Its existence was first reported by Mic, a New York-based news site targeted at millennials, in a post on Thursday that described how neo-Nazis and anti-Semites were using it to target Jews for abuse and harassment.

But despite the apparent danger, the Obama administration recently decided to fast-track the resettlement of refugees from Syria, a hotbed of Islamic violence. Whereas it usually takes 18 to 24 months for the government to process each refugee admission, the administration has now slashed the processing time to three months in an effort to reach its goal of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. Of the 1,366 Syrians already admitted this fiscal year, 99.2 percent are Muslims and only 0.6 percent are Christians.

CNN posted a story Tuesday titled, \"The truth about Muslims in America,\" which made a clear attempt to put forth the U.S. Muslim population's best foot while downplaying its darker side. The news agency cited a Pew Research study estimating that population at a \"minuscule\" 1 percent, and said roughly the same number of deadly terror attacks were committed by non-Muslims as Muslims between Sept. 11, 2001, and the end of 2014. The New York Times published a similar story about U.S. Muslims, saying Muslim-inspired attacks have killed 45 people since Sept. 11, 2001, while \"racist\" or \"anti-government\" whites killed 48 over the same time frame. But what this means, according to an article in National Review by Mark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, is that U.S. Muslims, with only 1 percent of the population, managed to account for half of all the terror attacks over a 13-year period.

It also sheds light on the political attitudes of Muslims worldwide. Pew writes : \"Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law.\" So if that is the case, why is the U.S. bringing in so many Muslims from those countries? And why did the U.S. government issue more green cards every year over the past three years to people from Muslim countries than to Europeans? The answer could be in the politics.

On Sunday, Obama addressed the nation on the terrorist threat. He vowed to stay the course on the plan to confront ISIS overseas, from continuing current policy on airstrikes to training rebels to working with allies to disrupt terrorist plots. Domestically, he pushed for action on gun control and possible changes to the spousal visa program, through which Tashfeen Malik entered the U.S. last year.

Overall, Harvey Kushner, director of the Terrorism and Homeland Security Institute at Long Island University, thought the speech fell very flat. \"He was there. At least he addressed the public, but he certainly didn't tamp down any fears that the public had and he certainly hasn't said anything new in terms of a strategy for fighting ISIS,\" said Kushner, who was especially underwhelmed when Obama called for banning gun sales to anyone whose name is on the No-Fly List and cracking down on so-called assault weapons.

DEBKAfile's military and intelligence sources report that on Wednesday, September 16, Russian R-166-0.5 (ultra) high-frequency signals (HF/VHF) vehicles were spotted on Highway 4, which links Homs and Aleppo. These vehicles, called \"mobile war rooms\" by the IDF and Western armies, were accompanied by BTR-82 troop carriers transporting Russian marines. The R-166-0.5 enables communication with forces located on battlefields as far as 1,000 kilometers away using high frequency and ultra-high frequency signals.

Extreme heat, sandstorms and floods all have been reported. \"It felt like the apocalypse, the rain has been torrential, there were about 10 lighting strikes in seconds, and even with your windshield wipers on high, it was impossible to see anything.\" That report in the Times of Israel from Mark Katz described just one of the recent developments: flash flooding and hail that hit earlier this week just as the nation was celebrating the new year.

Unlike here on earth, no pesky amateur radio eavesdroppers or curious hackers monitor the open sky between ground control and a drone\u2014not to mention between that drone and its communication satellite perched miles higher up. One small crew of hackers is trying to pierce that stratospheric secrecy zone with a high-altitude flying\u2014or at least floating\u2014machine of their own. The three members of a socially motivated movement of technologists known as Critical Engineering have developed and begun testing an \u201caerospace probe\u201d they call the Deep Sweep. The invention, described in their own detailed writeup, is a 1-foot-diameter acrylic orb packed with radio equipment and attached to a 8.2-foot diameter helium-filled weather balloon. As it floats up more than 15 miles into the earth\u2019s atmosphere, the probe\u2019s antennae are designed to record a wide range of radio data to be analyzed when the probe is recovered hours or days later.

Former British supermarket security guard Omar Hussain, writing under his ISIS name Abu Saeed al Britani, told Western Islamic radicals to think about the culture clash they will experience upon heading to the Middle East. The 27-year-old terrorist, originally from High Wycombe, England, expressed solidarity with his Arab peers in terms of chopping off heads and forming a caliphate, but found himself praying for patience when it came to dealing with their lack of basic manners. \"Arabs as a whole have a unique culture, which differs dramatically from the Western lifestyle. ...

{"title": "U.N. blurs line: 'Refugees,' job-seekers, terrorists", "content": "UNITED NATIONS \u2013 The United Nations continued on Wednesday to use the border crisis in Europe to blur the distinction between refugees legally entitled to asylum under international law and so-called \"migrants\" in search of jobs or welfare benefits. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon put war refugees and job seekers in the same category of \"people in need\" when he addressed the European border crisis at a press conference Wednesday. \"Men, women and children fleeing war and persecution deserve real support, including asylum. I ask those standing in the way of the rights of refugees to stand in their shoes. People facing barrel bombs and brutality in their country will continue to seek life in another. People with few prospects at home will continue to seek opportunity elsewhere. This is natural,\" he said. Announcing a Sept. 30 meeting of member states to \"mobilize a humane, effective and rights-based response\" to the refugee crisis, Ban Ki Moon called on all countries to \"live up to their legal obligations\" to accept refugees. TRENDING: See people clinging to U.S. jets leaving Afghanistan disaster The \"legal obligations\" he cited refer to the 1951 U.N. Convention on the Status of Refugees that requires nations to give refugees asylum with essentially the same rights as citizens. But that treaty, significantly, does not mention war in its definition of a refugee. Article One of the 1951 Convention says a refugee is someone forced to flee his home country \"owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\" Under the U.N. treaty terms, Syrian Christians, Kurds and Yazidis are refugees entitled to asylum, because, unlike Muslim Syrians, they face persecution due to their religion or nationality. Yet the U.N. criticized Poland and Slovakia for volunteering to accept Christian refugees, saying countries must accept everyone, regardless of religion. One could say Syrian Muslims who oppose the Assad regime face persecution because of \"political opinion,\" though they could conceivably find safe haven in ISIS-controlled areas of the country, and those who oppose ISIS could seek refuge in"}
